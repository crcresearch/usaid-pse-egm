      "Document Title": "Feasibility Study of the US-Pakistan Knowledge Corridor Scholarship Program",
      "Document Summary": "Published by the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) in collaboration with USAID, the feasibility study of the US-Pakistan knowledge corridor scholarship program gives an overview of the program with further details on the goals and plans of the Government of Pakistan for strengthening its higher education sector, theory of change underpinning Higher Education Commission (HEC)’s strategy, assumptions about how the education goals are prioritized, the estimated pipeline of potential candidates for the program, and associated costs. The report provides findings from the literature review and best practices on higher education capacity strengthening and scholarship programs with further information on integrating human capacity development with institutional performance improvement, lessons learned from past individual training programs, leveraging training for institutional impact, and government-sponsored scholarship programs for study in the United States. The report offers recommendations based on findings from the APLU assessment of program goals and strategies. Finally, the report talks about key considerations for implementing the scholarship program, program implementation options, detailed program implementation recommendations for the research grant model, and a summary of key considerations and recommendations. ",
      "Key Findings": "We can learn from past individual training programs and understand that there is an overemphasis on the individual's training objectives. Furthermore, institutional strengthening and training is conceived as separate with little crossover leverage. In programs with a clear focus on institutional strengthening, training is viewed as the driver to improve institutional performance. Additionally, institutional needs assessments are often biased towards identifying gaps in human resources, and particularly technical knowledge.\n\nThere is also minimal connection to home-country institutions and increasing but still limited attempts to build soft skills have been made. Action planning is not generally integrated into training programs and mentoring can be better utilized as a tool for institutional capacity development.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations for aligning program goals:\n1. Take an integrated approach leveraging individual training for institutional performance improvement.\n2. Start small, scale up to meet the broader goals for Pakistan’s higher education sector.\n3. Give serious consideration to the value of training students in cohorts.\n4. Find ways to further align the scholarship program with HEC’s goals for enhancing IT-embedded teaching and learning into the program.\n5. Consider supporting EdD, MFA/MS and MA degrees when those degrees are the terminal degree in the field.\n\nRecommendations for implementation:\nHighlighted Recommendations:\n• Invest in placement and advising services.\n• Invest significantly more in the preparation of students, beyond GRE and TOEFL.\n• Utilize action planning for HEC scholars.\n• Change eligibility criteria for students.\n• Adjust the timeline for recruitment to an 18-month cycle.\n• Send students on a J-1 visa.\n• Use Carnegie Classification to determine eligible host universities.\n• Invest in support to returning students – think about incentives beyond the five-year obligation.\n• Build in opportunities to conduct research in Pakistan during dissertation period.\n• Set up a competitive fund for dissertation research.",

There is a slightly greater concentration of investment in medical technology and devices. After speaking to investors, we understood this could be due to the perception that med tech/devices are often seen to have higher growth potential than service delivery, while digital health is still relatively nascent. In developed markets, pharmaceuticals and life sciences investors tend to be specialized given high technical expertise required and unique capital needs (large investments up front, high failure rate).",

      "Key Findings": "Findings suggest that delivery through agents/OTC and paper vouchers were the most common delivery mechanisms for CVA, while few instances of humanitarian organisations using e-vouchers, bank transfers, mobile money or direct cash were also reported.\n\nThe commonly reported choice for delivery through agents and paper vouchers appears to be a direct result of Yemen’s working environment, which was characterized by limitations regarding financial infrastructure, literacy, experience with formal banking institutions, access to hard-to-reach areas and mobility. Furthermore, community KIs commonly reported having experience with hawala, local exchange companies and bank agents, and reported a preference for receiving CVA using these actors.\n\nNonetheless, it was found that preparation, planning, monitoring and reconciliation may be challenging and time-consuming when conducting delivery through agents and paper vouchers. In this regard, tokens and SMS messaging were reported as mitigation measures that provided efficiency and improvement.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The findings suggest that stakeholders could:\n1.  Learn from each other by exchanging knowledge and best practices, e.g. in terms of agent management, available FSPs, and mitigating risks.",

      "Key Findings": "Humanitarian organisations work ever more often in partnership with local public or private bodies to support the health care and the water supply systems. They are trying to assess the privatisation trend and its consequences, and to adapt accordingly. New skills are needed to gain a better understanding of the private operators’ inputs and working methods, and to enhance the ability to negotiate appropriate arrangements with these newcomers to humanitarian crises. Finally, it is crucial to intensify the dialogue with states in order to guarantee respect for IHL in an armed conflict even as governments outsource some of their prerogatives to private actors.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The ICRC has identified several avenues for engaging the corporate sector. They include promoting knowledge of and respect for international humanitarian law among private firms operating in war-prone areas, as well as a frank dialogue — subject to the usual confidentiality requirements — with companies that have a direct or indirect influence on the users of violence. Joint efforts, i.e., with ad hoc corporate logistical support, may be envisaged when necessary and acceptable to the major stakeholders involved in a conflict.",

      "Document Title": "Teacher Effectiveness. Towards Sustainable Delivery of Continuing Professional Development in Zambia",
      "Document Summary": "This document is an effectiveness review report prepared by Creative Associates International, Inc. for review by USAID. It presents a sustainable, cost-effective, and affordable continuing professional development (CPD) delivery approach in Zambia, for head teachers, deputy head teachers, and teachers, focusing on the primary education level. The report draws on the best practices and lessons learned over the past decade or so, in the implementation of CPD interventions in Zambia by both the Ministry of General Education (MoGE) and various projects, including the Read to Succeed (RTS) project, implemented from 2012 to 2017. The report deals with various aspects of policy and planning framework, and legal framework.",
      "Key Findings": "According to this article, the head teacher is a key success factor at school level, as the instructional head of the school and as the local standards officer ‒ particularly given the scarcity of financial resources to facilitate school visits by standards officers. Additionally, with proper and consistent support, teachers are capable of working with minimum resources and still improve learner performance.The Lesson Study approach is useful and practical as a CPD vehicle to deliver teacher support programs.\n\nFurthermore, teachers feel motivated to engage in Lesson Study and try new approaches in class where they feel their lessons will be monitored by ZICs or DRCCs. In general, schools in rural areas, where staffing levels in subjects like Science and Mathematics are issues, tend to value Lesson Study activities more than those in urban areas. Commitment levels of the DEST and PEST affect the overall implementation of activities in the district and province.\n\nTo improve learner performance it is more effective to provide more direct support and services to zonal and individual schools and school level interventions and innovations are more effective if they are initiated and supported by individuals and groups within the schools or their communities. In addition, use of local resources should be promoted in all schools as instructional materials provided by MoGE HQ will never be adequate to meet the needs of the schools in the foreseeable future.\n\nGiven the inadequate public financing, there is need for innovation and improvisation; to do more with less; to use local resources and develop PPPs. Improved communication and interaction between district education officers, zones and schools/head teachers enhance teacher and learner performance.  And lastly, active and conscious participation of host country counterparts is important in planning, implementation and monitoring of project-supported interventions..\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The following are examples of key best practices developed to support CPD, as well as lessons learnt; most of those cited below are from the RTS project:\na) Best Practices\ni) CPD projects working through existing Ministry of Education and other relevant government structures, with regard to planning, implementation and monitoring of project interventions.\nii) CPD projects supporting the formulation and operationalisation of enabling policies and frameworks.\niii) Adopting the whole school, whole teacher, whole child approach to enhancing learner performance.\niv) Building the capacity of service providers, including PEST, DEST, ZEST and SEST.\nv) Focusing attention for training and other support on the district, zone and school levels and prioritising school-based CPD.\nvi) Promoting innovative development of locally relevant instructional materials, and using local human and material resources.\nvii) Promoting school-based assessment to support enhancement of teacher and learner performance.\nviii)Promoting cost-effective approaches in training, materials development and service delivery\nix) Promoting evidence-based decision making.\nx) Promoting exchanges among peers so that educators learn from each other.\nxi) Making effective use of innovative ICT technologies to enhance information and knowledge-sharing among educators.\nxii) Promoting school-community partnerships.\nxiii)Promoting mobilisation of supplementary resources through public-private partnerships.\nxiv)Incorporation of sustainability of project objectives and outcomes in the design, planning, implementation and monitoring of project interventions.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Government actions can undermine efforts to support victims. In the future, regular contact and coordination between humanitarian agencies, relevant private sector entities, and government ministries can provide a platform to identify and accommodate humanitarian KYC challenges before they become a problem at scale.\n- Access to financial services and adherence to KYC regulations are mutually attainable goals, even amidst crisis. Achieving both, however, requires planning and consideration of the specific needs of populations affected by humanitarian crises.",

Establishment of an internationally-recognised and accredited system of marking and identification for humanitarian relief shipments for quick and efficient detection. \n2. Adoption by Customs Administrations and relevant border agencies of the voluntary UN Officefor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Model Act for the Facilitation and\nRegulation of International Disaster Relief and Initial Recovery Assistance, in particular Chapter VI Part 29-36.\n3. Swift and robust implementation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA). The TFA does not make specific reference to the treatment of humanitarian relief shipments. However, the implementation of its provisions would significantly improve the facilitation of relief shipments throughout the supply chain.\n4. Establishment of contingency and trade resumption plans, developed in partnership with all stakeholders, including Customs, border agencies, donor organisations and the private sector. This is particularly vital for countries in areas that are more susceptible to natural disasters.\n5. Amendment to or drafting of supporting legislation to provide a more specific level of detail on customs clearance treatment, as usually this does not exist in the primary legislation.",

      "Document Summary": "This publication highlights the role that non-profit organizations and their senior staff can play in partnership formation and implementation. As a backdrop for introducing these critical success factors, this publication begins by discussing the evolution of collaboration between development stakeholders. It then frames the current partnership environment by examining external \"drivers\" and trends that are motivating development stakeholders to seek public-private collaboration. This is followed by a discussion of the critical factors for success that have emerged from INMED’s research: leadership, common ground, and accountability. The discussion includes practical information that non-profit executives and senior staff can use to determine the presence and evaluate the strength of these critical success factors in their own organizations and in those of potential partners. ",
      "Key Findings": "According to the article, programs implemented by public-private partnerships hold the promise of greater, longer-lasting social impact than programs operated by stakeholders working independently. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to partnership; what works best with one particular program, corporate culture, or partnership venture may not work at all in a different situation.\n\nLeaders of non-profits are in a position to assume a unique role in brokering and maintaining partnerships within the private sector, and in integrating the private sector contribution with that of governmental partners.This facilitating role is a demanding one and, to be effective, must be actively embraced by non-profit leadership. Lastly, non-profit leaders willing to take on the challenge must ensure, through their facilitating function, the presence of the fundamental factors critical for the success of the partnership.",
      "Key Recommendations": "We believe that leaders of non-profit organizations are in a unique position to communicate across sectors and skillfully facilitate the partnership process. Non-profit leaders willing to take on the challenge must ensure, through their facilitating function, the presence of the fundamental factors critical for the success of the partnership: committed leadership, common interests, and clear accountability for results.\n\nWhile the public-private partnership will not guarantee the success of development programs, the combined expertise and resources of governmental organizations, teamed with those of commercial and non-profit private sector entities, offer the promise of more creative, effective, and sustainable interventions to achieve humanitarian and development objectives worldwide.",

      "Document Title": "Opportunities and challenges of distributed manufacturing for humanitarian response",
      "Key Findings": "Distributed manufacturing, where decentralized small, local sites are engaged in production, often supported by digital systems and networks, can be a powerful tool in humanitarian aid. Field Ready uses distributed manufacturing to produce essential non-food items locally where they are needed during humanitarian responses. Such supplies can be available to communities in need and to relief workers more quickly, more cheaply than alternatives, and provide appropriate solutions to problems, often engaging local people in designing and making necessary items, and supporting economic development. Scaling up this requires local production capabilities (skills, tools, and information such as designs), which can be boosted by adoption of these methods by aid agencies, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and others. Local manufacturing offers the potential for disaster affected communities to be engaged in recovery, and long term to become more resilient, with access to all the equipment and information required to make the supplies they need. However, there are challenges: appropriate quality control for distributed manufacture, unlocking the potential for in-region manufacturers to engage in humanitarian response, and uptake of digital knowledge sharing and collaboration to the humanitarian sector. In this paper, we share experiences of human-centred design and global collaboration to solve local problems, of manufacturing in remote and challenging locations, community building and bridging sectors through the Humanitarian Makers network, and new ideas for distributed manufacturing standards and quality.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- To deliver reliable manufacturing of items, the documentation in support of actual design files needs to be good enough to enable someone who was not involved in the design process to reproduce the item. To have high confidence in the reproducibility and reliability of a manufacturing process and design in multiple contexts, testing could be carried out by people in many different settings, with the results reported back and collated.\n- When designing items that will be made in distributed,\ndigital ways in low resource environments, consideration can\nbe given to how the maker or user can check they have a good\nitem.\n- Whilst low resource environments do not offer the test and\ninspection options of a developed world factory, new\ntechnologies show high potential for field testing. For instance, computer vision continues to improve, even when using commodity hardware such as the cameras available in\nsmartphones. This could potentially be combined with lens\nenhancements or phone add-on modules, plus online or offline\nprocessing and perhaps machine learning, to offer smart\ninspection systems for field use.",

In many cases, protecting their business operations in order to get back up and running quickly after a disaster is the best thing a business can do for its community. What we are also finding is that companies are developing advanced technologies to help communities not just withstand disasters but also deliver benefits that contribute to their long-term development. Business processes are driving risk management. The insurance and reinsurance industries have played fundamental roles in educating business owners and\noperators about the importance of disaster mitigation\nand preparedness. It is in their self-interest to encourage\nbusinesses and communities to be as resilient as possible,\nwhich pays off for everyone if a disaster happens. Logistics companies are also playing a huge role in helping\nmanage disruptions due to extreme events. As you might\nexpect, UPS and FedEx are on the cutting edge of this as\noutlined in the report, but companies like Walmart and Cargill\nare also logistics experts in terms of getting supply chains\nflowing again and needed goods and services back into\ncirculation in a community.

      "Key Findings": "When a disaster strikes, apart from the government response, a variety of other actors also step in to provide support, including non-profit organizations, aid organizations, international organizations, local communities and individual agents.  The private sector provides post-disaster support, albeit in a less systematic, more ad- hoc manner. Strategic and planned\npartnerships between the government and the private sector for disaster recovery and mitigation remains an area for improvement. In this context, government effectiveness can be strengthened by leveraging existing private sector capacities and core competencies. Indeed, effectively involving the private sector in disaster recovery can open opportunities to increase resilience and reduce pre-disaster risks by building back better (BBB). Private participation in disaster recovery can also allow for faster and more efficient recovery efforts at a time when governments are already overstretched. Therefore, under the right enabling conditions, the private sector can make a very positive contribution toward disaster recovery and mitigation both in the short- and long-term. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The authors make the following recommendations: establish processes and agreements prior to a disaster; formally include the private sector in government disaster preparedness planning; provide an enabling legal and regulatory environment for the quick and efficient use of private sector resources and expertise; engage with international agencies to explore the use of credit enhancement instruments to encourage PSP.

      "Document Title": "Parametric Insurance Cover for Natural Catastrophe Risks",
      "Key Findings": "With economic losses of over USD 370 billion caused by 325 catastrophic events, 2011 ranks as the worst ever year in terms of costs to society due to natural catastrophes and man-made disasters. In the same time, 2011 is the second most expensive year in the history for the insurance industry, with insured losses from catastrophic events amounting to USD 116 bn. Both the high level of damages and insured losses, as well as the unprecedented gap between the two values, made insurers and reinsurers worldwide to understand that some risks had so far been underestimated and they have to be better integrated in the catastrophes modelling. On the other hand, governments have to protect themselves against the financial impact of natural catastrophes and new forms of cooperation between the public and private sectors can help countries finance disaster risks. Viewed in a country’s wider risk management context, the purchase of parametric insurance cover, which transfers natural catastrophe risk to the private sector using an index-based trigger, is a necessary shift towards a pre- emptive risk management strategy. This kind of approach can be pursued by central governments or at the level of provincial or municipal governments, and a number of case studies included in the publication “Closing the financial gap” by Swiss Re (2011) illustrates how new forms of parametric insurance can help countries finance disaster risks.\nThe main factors contributing to this growth are significant economic development, population growth, concentration of assets in areas exposed to catastrophic risks and accelerated climate changes of the last two decades. Damage size varies of course from country to country depending on the nature and intensity of catastrophic events, but everywhere it is found that most of the damage still remains uninsured. On average, over the last 20 years, only between 20% and 40% of the damage was insured. Level of insurance coverage depends on the insurance market development. In this respect the calculation of insurance penetration in national economies (the ratio between gross written premiums and GDP) shows, in the non-life insurance sector, a persistence of a significant gap between developed countries, where this indicator stands at 8.6%, and developing countries with only 2.9%.",
      "Key Recommendations": "As a first priority, governments should ensure a functioning insurance market. This will help to absorb a big part of disaster losses suffered by individuals and businesses.\nThen, pre-event financing solutions that build up reserves, contingent finance as well as sovereign insurance solutions can alleviate the remaining financial burden on governments.\nPost-disaster financing through budgetary means, debt financing or donor aid should only come into play to cover residual losses once all other risk transfer solutions have been\nexhausted.\nBy building up financial reserves or using insurance solutions, governments can reduce their financial burden after a disaster occurs. These measures also lower the volatility on the government budget and help improve planning certainty for the public sector. But\ndisaster financing instruments should never be seen in isolation. Rather, they must be viewed in a country’s wider risk management context.\nViewed in such a context, the purchase of parametric insurance cover, which transfers natural catastrophe risk to the private sector using an index-based trigger, is a necessary shift towards a pre-emptive risk management strategy.",

      "Key Findings": "• Evidence remains limited about the private sector’s contribution to immunization service delivery, impact on equity of immunization services, and interaction between pharmaceutical industry and the private sector.\n• While there are a number of countries that have successfully engaged with the private sector, others have had limited involvement or experienced challenges with private sector provision of immunization services.\n• Given countries’ varying and unique characteristics, a standard approach to engaging the private sector is unrealistic. However, identifying characteristics of strong programmes to guide and adapt to the country context is useful. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Furthermore, expanding the current body of evidence is essential to elucidate characteristics of a well-functioning immunization program. Areas that need to be highlighted as a research priority include: \n1) private sectors role in geographic scope leading to forecasting demand and stock-outs;\n 2) effectiveness of regulatory requirements and potential enforcement mechanisms; \n3) best practices for incorporation of private sector provision of immunization services into the NIP;\n 4) identification of where private providers are securing vaccines and if vaccines are licensed. \nAdditionally, the role of immunization delivery in private schools was not captured and should be addressed as a priority area given centrality of school-based immunization programs to meet coverage targets and compliance with national schedules. Through these mechanisms and extension of research, the interaction between public and private sectors can be optimized and immunization services can be strengthened to meet the goals laid forth by GVAP.",

      "Document Title": "The Private Sector and Aid\nEffectiveness: Toward New Models\nof Engagement",
      "Key Findings": "Private-sector contributions and market-based approaches to development are by no means a panacea. Their potential can be undermined by governance gaps, market failures and bad business practices. Some of these obstacles can be overcome by collaboration with other development actors. Others call for regulatory oversight or vigilant nonprofit watchdogs and an open media. There will always be a need for governments, donors, philanthropists and NGOs to\nprovide social services, cash transfers and safety nets to the poorest, most vulnerable communities.\n\nAt the same time, the private sector is an important part of efforts to improve development out-comes and stretch limited official development assistance and philanthropic dollars. Therefore, the donor\ncommunity should collaborate more actively and closely with businesses at the operational and policy levels, both domestically and globally. There is great potential to jointly develop innovative new financing\nmechanisms, technologies and business models that will deliver more inclusive green growth in developing countries.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To achieve better aid effectiveness and development outcomes, the private sector and official donors must:\n\n1. Cooperate to improve business investment climates\n2. Establish or strengthen mechanisms to ensure mutual accountability\n3. Scale up innovation to build inclusive and green value chains\n4. Coordinate efforts to strengthen health systems\n5. Build coalitions to enhance humanitarian assistance \n5. Integrate private sector participation into the dialogue on aid effectiveness.",

      "Key Findings": "Concerning the non-financial support of the surveyed foundations, many of them aligned their response to the pandemic with their general funding strategy as agreed by their trustees. In this respect, five distinct types of non-financial contributions could be identified:\n1. Increased flexibility. Approximately one-third of foundations, such as the Dutch Postcode Lottery and the MAVA Foundation, announced flexibility to their existing partners by lifting administrative obligations (e.g. reporting deadlines). Some philanthropies, e.g. the Ford Foundation, also loosened the restrictiveness of their grant making and allowed their partners to use earmarked funds for other purposes. In a similar fashion, some lending foundations initiated debt rescheduling discussions with their clients.\n2. Continuation of usual pay-out. While the crisis affected foundations’ endowment, many foundations manifested support to their trustees by committing to continue their grant making activities as usual and to refrain from budget cuts. \n3. Technical assistance. Another type of non-financial support was technical assistance, such as distributing guidance on crisis management, providing IT literacy training to facilitate teleworking or conducting various research activities related to the COVID-19.\n4. Large-scale fundraising. Several foundations showed their leadership by fundraising, establishing vehicles and launching influential engagement campaigns. For example, the Wellcome Trust announced its Covid-Zero initiative calling for USD 8 billion from the official sources and the private sectors and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) engaged in mobilising G7 leaders to secure coordinated international response.\n5. In-kind contributions. Some of the surveyed foundations provided in-kind contributions, such as medical equipment.",

      "Document Title": "Partnerships with the Private Sector: Success Factors and Levels of Engagement in Development Cooperation",
      "Key Findings": "1. The cases of the AS and of the GPEDC have shown that, at the national level, it seems to be easier to enhance and maintain the engagement of private-sector actors in development initiatives because the terms of cooperation are more specific. This is particularly relevant in the context of the 2030 Agenda to specify expected outcomes according to local\nneeds and to generate ownership in the process. Thus, national devel-\nopment agencies are important focal points whose efforts need to be\nstrengthened when aiming at incentivising private-sector engagement in development cooperation.\n2. To scale-up the impact of multi-stakeholder initiatives with private-sector actors, both at the global and national levels, monitoring frameworks are needed. Although they should be aligned with the 2030 Agenda in order to evaluate the expected outcomes of such initiatives, it is necessary to differentiate between the different formats of multi-actor partnerships and the settings in which they operate. The GPEDC and the\nAS, for example, try to enhance private-sector engagement for different purposes, as both partnerships are driven by different objectives. Ideally, the evaluation results deriving from such frameworks are used as a basis for further dialogue across the different levels of engagement—for example among AMEXCID and other development agencies in emerging economies or the GPEDC—to enhance knowledge transfer and the identification of unused potentials and challenges for international and South-South initiatives.",

      "Key Findings": "In the opinion of the authors, however, an approach to business processes that recognizes the realities of a people focused organization (Figure 4) could succeed. Processes must support staff in their key motivation, which is to get things done as quickly as possible to alleviate the human suffering that they see around them. Any process design and system implementation must recognize the expectations of users; that systems are there to support them and not just to deliver data to some far distant management entity. The systems must provide immediate value to the user (for example by displaying relevant knowledge depending on the progression of the process), must mimic the\ncurrent intuitive applications of the internet generations (such as Skype, Facebook and Twitter) and must have a compelling accessibility (for example using local language). Creating a climate for investment in such systems requires donors who can understand the potential value of optimizing business processes. The ongoing costs of reviewing and optimizing processes and the IT systems that support them must be funded. The rewards from such an investment, would have the potential to improve the lives\nof vulnerable people far more than directly investing in specific programs in the field.",

Investigations into the following areas will help to address some of the main issues identified: How can one measure the success of BPM initiatives within the humanitarian context? How can capabilities be built and sustained within the sector? What IT capabilities are necessary for the adoption and successful conduct of BPM? What are the unique characteristics of people focused (as opposed to task/process focused) organizations? What methods, tools and techniques will be successful in improving the processes of such\npeople focused enterprises?",

      "Document Summary": "PSI West Africa, Sanitation Service Delivery (SSD) Program is a Communication Framework designed to build the communications capacity of the SSD Team. The framework is built to align with the SSD Program Knowledge Management Strategy 2015-2019, and 2016 review. It presents a logical flow answering the questions: What to share? With whom? How to share? Who is responsible and in what timeframe? The framework has proposed a template that can be used to capture learning on an individual level. At a team level, an after-action review (AAR) has been considered a useful way to learn what happened and why, review successes and challenges, and make any required changes in direction. ",
      "Key Findings": "The communications framework presented here aims to address\nthese needs by identifying a set of broad learning questions that help focus learning on sector knowledge gaps and by mapping target audiences, the decisions or actions the SSD team hopes to influence, and the communication channels they use.\n\nFurthermore, they can address the needs by providing a template for detailed communications planning and responsibilities, a template to help teams to systematically capture lessons and data from the field and finally providing links to guidance on preparing communications products such as blogs and success stories. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Learning questions should be revisited periodically; evolution of the learning questions will be reflected in prioritisation of audience and communication channels; which in turn guides communications planning.\n\nIn addition to the learning questions, there needs to be a systematic way for SSD field teams to identify, capture and share the wealth of learning and ideas that SSD implementation work produces.\n\nBy encouraging all staff to reflect often on what they have heard and learnt as they go about their daily implementation work, SSD can encourage a culture of learning and address a gap that was identified by teams in both Benin and Cote d’Ivoire.",

      "Document Summary": "This performance evaluation provides lessons learned and recommendations for future activities in relation to private sector development for consideration by the USAID / West Bank Gaza (USAID/WBG) Economic Growth and Infrastructure (EGI) team. The report shows that the project was successful in terms of demonstrating astute value chain understanding, it was equally the case that sector analysis, strategy, and intended results are inconsistently documented in any robust form. It is also reported that the project’s best results were achieved when either a market is already secured where a clearly identified market opportunity exists, or where an opportunity exists to activate a niche within a market. Those firms supported by Compete produce inputs and provide value-adding services previously needing to be purchased externally believe they are able to produce at a lower cost per unit than imported inputs and this is seen as paving the road to sustainability. Compete demonstrates that when a clear and accessible market opportunity exists, the private sector appears to be generally capable of managing itself forward in that market. ",
      "Key Findings": "Since commencing in 2012, the Compete project has made a very important contribution to the Palestinian economy, being an important catalyst for private sector engagement of export markets across key sectors. As the largest project of its kind, the project has significant profile right across the Palestinian economy, and is valued by the private sector for its capacity to respond to sector development needs, cost share, pilot and scale-up innovation, advise and help facilitate linkages with export markets and buyers.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The headline recommendation of this performance evaluation is that USAID commit to further support and progress competitiveness of the Palestinian economy through interventions in both West Bank and Gaza. Results achieved through Compete demonstrate that strategic and considered support to sectors and businesses can be catalytic in strengthening export readiness, building investor confidence and addressing bottlenecks, resulting in a strengthened Palestinian economy and growth in employment opportunities.",

      "Document Summary": "The report summarizes the input that scholars and practitioners working in the field of HICD have offered to enhance USAID programming to better achieve an innovative agricultural system capable of feeding the world in the 21st century. The report also presents the comments raised by outside panelists, BIFAD members, and the public at the BIFAD meeting held in Washington, D.C. on February 27, 2015, to suggest possible next steps in HICD research and activities. Together the reports offered over thirty recommendations to be considered by different stakeholders, including USAID, universities in the U.S. and in developing countries, national agricultural research institutions, NGOs, and firms. The three reports, each of which examines different dimensions of HICD include: i) Human and Institutional Capacity Development: Role of USAID and Title XII Under Feed the Future Programs (2014) by Victor Lechtenberg (Purdue University), Albert Ayeni (Rutgers University), Ralph Christy (Cornell University), and Carol Kramer-LeBlanc (Consultant), ii) Good Practices in Leveraging Long-term training for Institutional Capacity Strengthening (2014) by Andrew Gilboy and Anne-Claire Hervy; and, iii) African Higher Education: Opportunities for Transformative Change for Sustainable Development (2014). The main focus of the report is a synthesis of the participants’ comments during the three-day e-consultation or AgExchange.",
      "Key Findings": "We can enhance HICD that emerged from AgExchange by:\n\n1. Designing human and institutional capacity development activities strategically, ensuring that individual leadership, management, and technical skills strengthen institutions.\n2. Strengthening long-term institutional capacity development activities.\n3. Building diverse partnerships of mutual interest and motivation.\n4. Supporting programs to be flexible, adaptable, and responsive to market need.\n5. Building both human and institutional networks.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To organize a series of targeted convening with diverse partners on key topics emerging from AgExchange.\n2. To support investments in cost-effective, documented “best practices” for institutional change that would: i) include an analysis of the reasons that previous recommendations have not been\nimplemented, ii) test recommendations against evidence, and iii) identify the most critical constraints to success.\n3. To initiate and moderate a conversation about identifying goals for institutional performance and assessment that would be of mutual benefit for USAID and universities.",

The report does not follow any systematic approach in its structure and does not provide further details on the methodological aspects. The evaluation team has come up with findings, and an opportunity was given to SEED management to express their views. Across the report, the evaluation team has expressed strong disagreement with SEED’s response to the findings.",
      "Key Findings": "Inadequate cross-component coordination and output-focused M&E indicators have reduced SEED’s efficiency from the outset, making it more difficult to see overarching objectives and engage stakeholders/beneficiaries in multiple component activities. However, recent changes in management have significantly strengthened operating and M&E systems while increasing awareness among technical staff of critical higher-level programmatic objectives. As SEED does not consistently disaggregate gender data nor track baselines upon which to compare, it is not possible to prove that gender differences or gaps were appropriately addressed by the project.  There is no evidence of situation analyses to determine the types of financial products required by MSMEs, e.g., the financial literacy training materials used with 200 Agricultural Bank employees detail differences in financial products but do not address practical money management or financial practices for growing small businesses. With some of these findings and recommendations, SEED really needs to work hard to address the issues that are identified by the evaluation team.",
      "Key Recommendations": "One of the recommendations that the evaluation team has made for SEED is to follow a more systematic approach while assessing the development needs of its stakeholders and beneficiaries including disadvantaged populations prior to any new interventions to make SEED’s performance further better. The evaluation team suggests that more concentrated effort while choosing and working with fewer public sectors with a narrower intervention focus will have a high probability of success. ",

      "Document Summary": "Published by the USAID/ Feed the Future Project, the Private sector consultation on climate-smart agriculture is a PowerPoint presentation that gives an overview of the private sector’s understanding of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and suggests alternative pathways to better engage the private sector in CSA activities. The short presentation covers the findings from the consultation of coffee companies in the way they think about climate risk and climate-smart agriculture, the types of activities in which they engage, and the types of climate information they use and/or need. \n\nThe results of this study are supplemented by results from a case study of Ugandan coffee companies, illustrating the use and need for climate information differs at the national level. The results give insight into the types of information that private sector companies are looking for to be able to design and implement effective climate-smart agriculture programs.",
      "Key Findings": "One of the key findings of this study is that in order to successfully approach companies and tailor tools and resources to their needs, tool/resource developers need to understand the role of climate-smart agriculture within their business model and sustainability strategy, their motivations for investing in climate-smart agriculture and the types of tools and resources that would most benefit them. \n\nThere is some confusion over what is “climate smart” especially for those working close to the farm level and as such, information needs to be easily accessible and usable with better cross-sector collaboration. It is increasingly difficult to balance the need for short-term outcomes and longer-term investment/results.\n\nFurthermore, there is a need to make a business case around climate smart efforts – Cost and ROI are critical for investment decision-making. The report \n\nDepending on the company role as direct service provider, collaborator or catalyst, they have different challenges to investing in climate smart agriculture",
      "Key Recommendations": "The report suggests an almost universal engagement and enthusiasm that the sector – companies, farmers, government, donors, research, and NGOs – must tackle this threat together and act fast. There was a sense of urgency and even impatience from some that the strategies and programs must be better coordinated, informed by credible science, and rigorously practical for farmers’ realities. With access to the right information in the right format, coffee companies will be more likely to utilize tools and resources to make informed decisions in the face of climate change.\n\nCurrent Needs:\nTo help farmers: \nSimple, uniform messages.\nSpecific practices to address specific problems (also to address currently observed climate change impacts).\n\nFor private sector actors:\nUpdated information in short info briefs, presentations, videos, etc.\nFocusing more on the short-term, but still need to keep awareness raising about the long-term implications of Climate Change (without scaremongering).",

The review highlighted areas in which the private sector is delivering appropriate care to TB patients and areas that could be improved. The report discusses seven key opportunities that surfaced across the patient journey. Throughout this review, potential solutions were informed by private sector patient and provider perspectives, as well as input from the NTP, Dinas Kesehatan officials, and other stakeholders.",
      "Key Findings": "The findings of this review focus in four areas: BPJS-K participation, awareness of and participation in TB programming, the patient pathway, and key opportunities for improving the quality of private sector TB care.\n\nBPJS-K Participation.\nOf the patients interviewed, 85% were enrolled in BPJS-K, and those patients who had coverage were familiar with BPJS-K policies and typically used it to pay for their TB care.\n\nPerspective on TB Guidelines and Programming.\nAmong doctors interviewed, 68% of GPs, 69% of internists, and 80% of pulmonologists said that they are aware of national guidelines regarding TB, and nearly all the remaining interviewees reported that they are at least somewhat aware\n\nPatient Pathway\nThis review was consistent with existing evidence that many people with TB symptoms first seek symptom-relieving care at private pharmacies. When the patients interviewed for this review decided to see a doctor, 65% visited a primary care provider, and 44% of those went to a Pusat Kesehatan Masyarakat (Puskesmas), or community health center.\n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Throughout this review, potential solutions were informed by private sector patient and provider perspectives, as well as input from the NTP, Dinas Kesehatan officials, and other stakeholders. The solutions offered are:\n- Regulation is not a sufficient lever to drive behavior change in the private sector.\n- Incentives have the greatest potential to change behavior in the private sector.\n- Solutions for private providers must meet private providers’ needs: they must be targeted, simple, and consistent.\n- Recognize that patients play an important role in their own care.\n- Diagnosis is a key point of intervention, and improved diagnostic options are needed, especially in primary care.\n- Increase focus on primary care, both improving quality and retaining patients.",

The result was a set of clear, actionable recommendations by impact zone and by farmer’s abilities, paving the way for companies to improve the targeting of their agronomic training and support to farmers affected by climate change. Companies found it easiest to work through World Cocoa Foundation to minimize the confusion of too many stakeholders, and companies see a strong need for further CCAFS Consortium research to reinforce the CSC recommendations and make the business case to farmers to apply adaptation practices by showing in $$ terms the costs and benefits of different farm investments were two main learnings came out from this engagement.",

      "Document Summary": "Improving Cocoa Sector Climate-Smart Awareness and Decision-making is a case study from the private sector engagement in the USAID learning community for supply chain resilience. This case study shares lessons from industry engagement with the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)-led Consortium’s research on climate-smart cocoa in Ghana, in connection with the USAID Feed the Future Climate-Smart Cocoa Program, led by the World Cocoa Foundation (WCF). \n\nWhile a large cross-section of the industry has been engaged in the effort, this document focuses on a subset of the companies engaged. Included are company-specific case studies which describe how Touton, Ecom, and The Hershey Company (Hershey), have leveraged the decision-support tools produced by CCAFS, namely climate suitability maps, the science underpinning the Climate Smart Cocoa Manual with recommendations by impact zone and various climate-smart agriculture (CSA) Apps. The report shares companies’ constructive feedback on remaining gaps and opportunities and concludes with potential future directions for CCAFS and USAID for effective partnerships with the industry. Accordingly, recommendations have been made to deepen collaboration with the national government, alongside private sector companies to increase effectiveness and expand financing options for cocoa farmers to be able to implement climate-smart recommendations such as tree renovation and rehabilitation, general farm maintenance, and help farmers to diversify income streams and transition to new crops that will require significant additional research, investment, and training. Without companies leading the charge here, there is a risk, without near-term prioritization by public entities that these communities fall through the cracks and slide deeper into poverty.",
      "Key Findings": "Initial interviews revealed that the cocoa industry was primarily investing in the Sustainable Productivity Pillar of climate-smart agriculture through their investments in Cocoa Action. Some investment was also happening in small farmer livelihoods through efforts like the Cocoa Livelihood Program and companies’ own sustainability programs. Mitigation of GHG Emissions has only become a core focus of the industry with the recent commitments made to the Cocoa & Forests Initiative, with pledges to preserve standing forests and implement climate-smart cocoa on existing farms.\n\nThe CCAFS consortium focused on the third pillar, enabling more investment and action on the Adaptation for Resilience Pillar of CSA.\n\nThe interviews also highlighted two main benefits:\n1. Fostering a shared definition and understanding of climate-smart cocoa. Prior to these meetings, there had been varied levels of understanding among company sustainability teams of climate-smart cocoa. These meetings helped to clarify the distinction, namely the call to take into account varied vulnerability in different zones, and correspondingly different recommendations for adaptation practices or transformation practices. Based on this shared understanding, companies could act on their new knowledge and customize recommendations by vulnerability zone.\n\n2. Gaining familiarity with climate tools and analytics. Company sustainability teams are stretched thin, often dealing with information overload from all the reports that cross their inboxes. The climate-smart cocoa meetings were helpful forums for highlighting the key takeaways of the research and exposing companies to key outputs of the CCAFS work, i.e., the climate suitability maps of the different vulnerability zones and the CSC Manual.",

There is opportunity to increase effectiveness by deepening collaboration with national government, alongside private sector companies.\n\n2. Companies shared that farmers lack financing options to implement many of the Climate Smart Cocoa (CSC) recommendations.\n\n3. There is need for public investment in Transform Zones.\n",

      "Document Summary": "The report provides important highlights on the implementation of USAID funded “The Ghana Trade Africa: Trade Facilitation Project (TATFP) in 2016” as a part of the wider Trade Africa initiative, which sought to increase internal and regional trade within Africa and expand trade and economic ties between Africa and the United States. Ghana TATFP supported the Government of Ghana (GoG) in the implementation of its commitments under the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA). More specifically the report addresses the four TFA Articles they are Article 1: Publication and Availability of Information (Enquiry Points and Notifications), Article 6: Trade-Related Fees and Charges, Article 7.4: Customs Risk Management, and Article 8: Border Agency Cooperation and Joint Inspections. \n\nWhile TFA implementation represented the core of Ghana’s TATFP activities, the report also responded to windows of opportunity and requests from USAID/Ghana and the Government of Ghana to reform numerous policy initiatives in its high economic priorities. Some of the examples include support for Ghana’s Export-Import Bank (GEXIM), the development of a medium-term revenue policy (MTRP) for the Ministry of Finance, and the development of a Risk Register Template for the Ministry of Finance. The report presents lessons learned identified during the implementation of the Ghana TATFP as well. The report further highlights that Ghana TATFP, in a relatively short period of time, has been able to bring considerable improvements as countries continue to advance their development agendas, which wouldn’t have been possible without dedicated support and partnership with the Government of Ghana’s counterparts, active private sector engagement, and development partner colleagues. ",
      "Key Findings": "In just over two years, the TATFP either built upon and/or supported the development of new mechanisms for inter-agency communications; drafted research reports and developed recommendations and tools for the GoG; organized dissemination and launch events on policies and agreements; and aided in the coordination of development partner activities. Technical assistance provided by Ghana TATFP has resulted in increased compliance with the TFA, including the framework for a sustainable path forward for Ghana’s NTFC. The TATFP also provided direct capacity-building support to MOTI, MoF, GRA – Customs, and GEXIM, enabling these authorities to better develop policies and internal practices to enhance Ghana’s competitiveness in the region and improve relationships with Ghana’s trading partners.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Leverage available resources to build sustainability of results.\n\nBe nimble and look for opportunity to adapt as appropriate.\n\nCoordinate with donors and other stakeholders throughout the life of project.",

      "Document Summary": "Implementation of the Global Health Initiative (GHI) is a consultation document that provides thoughtful insight on a new business model to deliver GHI’s dual objectives of achieving significant health improvements and creating an effective, efficient, and country-led platform for sustainable delivery of essential health care and public health programs. The document is a highlight of the Obama Administration’s global health initiative which considers strategic investments in global health to mean progress in economic development, job creation, education, agricultural development, gender equity, and political stability impacting the security and prosperity of the United States. President Obama’s Global Health Initiative has recognized how health programs and weak systems in many developing countries are not meeting the needs of their population. While health services may be available, too often, they exist in an uncoordinated or ad hoc manner aligned around funding sources or diseases rather than the broader needs of the populations they seek to serve. The GHI helps partner countries improve health outcomes through strengthened health systems, with a particular focus on improving the health of women, newborns, and children through programs including infectious disease, nutrition, maternal and child health, and safe water. \n\nThe document highlights that building functioning systems will, in some cases, require a new way of thinking about health investments with increased attention to the appropriate deployment of health professionals, improved distribution of medical supplies, and improved functioning of information and logistics systems all while maintaining a focus on delivering results. In the end, success will be measured not by the robustness of the health system itself but by a country’s ability to meet the needs of key populations and improve health conditions. To meet this vision, the GHI will use a new business model for U.S. government global health assistance. The initiative will deliver on that commitment through a business model based on GHI’s core principles, drawn from the principles of effective development partnership announced by President Obama at the G-8 meeting in L’Aquila that includes implementing a female-centered approach, coordination, collaboration, and integration at all levels strengthening and leveraging other efforts, partnership with countries, and learning and accountability. \n\nThe document emphasizes that the Obama Administration’s Global Health Initiative has the opportunity to move global health to a new level of effectiveness, with a vision of long-term sustainability led by partner countries. Seizing that opportunity requires new investments in programs that recognize the centrality of women and girls to the long-term health and well-being of families, communities, and countries and that foster the development and expansion of high-performing and sustainable platforms for service delivery and the implementation of public health programs. It is one that the Obama Administration embraces as the leading edge of a future-oriented vision of this country’s contributions to global development.",
      "Key Findings": "Building on a long tradition of U.S. government global health leadership and the unprecedented level of commitment manifested in recent years, the Obama Administration’s Global Health Initiative has the opportunity to move global health to a new level of effectiveness, with a vision of long-term sustainability led by partner countries. Seizing that opportunity requires new investments in programs that recognize the centrality of women and girls to long-term health and well-being of families, communities, and countries, and that foster the development and expansion of high- performing and sustainable platforms for service delivery and the implementation of public health programs. This is an ambitious endeavor that requires a full measure of commitment and collaboration across U.S. government agencies and with our global and national partners. It is one that the Obama Administration embraces as the leading edge of a comprehensive, future-oriented vision of this country’s contributions to global development.",
      "Key Recommendations": "While specific disease and system priorities will vary by country, GHI implementation has four main components:\n1. Do more of what works\n2. Build on and expand existing platforms to foster stronger systems and sustainable results\n3. Innovate for results\n4. Collaborate for impact",

      "Document Summary": "\"USAID Resource Guide for Family Planning” is a guide to tools and resources to support family planning programming and advocacy, which has pulled together key resources for Family Planning (FP) programming and advocacy at the country level. Section I of the document provides resources on advocacy, evidence-based family planning, recommended resources for FP programming, policy, etc. with a broad range of links to materials. Section II of the document provides a widely referenced publication such as “family planning saves lives, family planning for health and development, and fast facts: family planning with an external link to view the documents. \n\nSection III of the document provides resources related to population and reproductive health (PRH) technical leadership areas such as community-based family planning, contraceptive security, family planning-MNCH Integration, long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), and permanent methods (PMs), healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies (HTSP), postabortion care (PAC), poverty and health equity, gender, youth, repositioning family planning in Sub-Saharan Africa, family planning-HIV integration, and high impact practices (HIPs) with the implementation framework. The document employs seven GHI core programming principles to instruct how it engages in global health. Section IV of the document lists the PRH, maternal and child health (MCH), and the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) priority countries as well as the PRH centrally funded health projects. Section V of the document highlights high-impact practices and the elements to success in family planning, both references underscore proven evidence-based best practices in FP programming and policy. The documents are designed to inform program investments and are not intended to replace national FP strategies. Rather, their purpose is to synthesize knowledge and evidence for those advocating, designing, and overseeing FP funding and programs. These documents are intended to facilitate the use of evidence and experience by program managers and policymakers.\n\nSection VI features a range of lessons learned documents, briefs, guidance, and toolkits in FP including promising practice areas such as mHealth, mobile services, vouchers, etc. The documents provide links to tools, toolkits, and resources on FP practices and technical priority areas. This section also provides links to lessons learned documents in emerging and promising practices, where the evidence base is less robust, as well as lessons learned in proven practices. It also includes an overview and screenshot of the interactive HIPs map, showing ongoing programs in select HIPs in FP and a link to the Global Health eLearning website. Section VII provides links to wide-ranging FP programming resources. Included in this section are documents on FP indicators, program evaluation tools, USAID FP compliance materials, legislative guidance, resources on integration of services, sustainability, gender integration, private sector engagement, SEED programming model, and the ‘Guide to Fostering Change’ document. Section VIII highlights high-level policy advocacy resources that are designed to inform national FP guidelines and policies and provide resources for interactions with Ministries of Health. Section IX provides a comprehensive listing of tools, toolkits, resources, etc. on family planning and is updated regularly.",

For most companies increasing farmer resilience to climate change does not require a new technology but simply requires dissemination of useful information throughout the supply chain. NGOs are well suited to provide data and create solutions like guides, apps and training manuals because they often have experience working directly with farmers, extension officers and other field staff that are able to make real change among farmers.",

      "Document Title": "Using Political Economy Analysis for Biodiversity Conservation Planning",
      "Document Summary": "\"Using political economy analysis for biodiversity conservation planning” is a case study report on artisanal gold mining in Kahuzi-Biéga National Park (KBNP) in the DRC, Uganda’s Lake Albert, and Madagascar’s Marine protected areas. This report explains the technical findings from using USAID’s Applied Political Economic Analysis (PEA) Framework for biodiversity conservation in the context of extractives. Synthesizing the key findings of these, the case study illustrates that threats to biodiversity are political and criminal and often involve conflict with customary rights to resources. The report shows how applied PEA is helpful in understanding the dynamics and incentives that accompany resource extraction. Threats to biodiversity not only affect the resources directly but also shape the behaviors of resource-dependent communities. For that reason, applied PEA can better inform conservation programming by explaining how potential points of leverage might be exploited to change behaviors in a positive direction. \n\nAll three cases highlight the importance of establishing conflict resolution mechanisms to address long-standing grievances, resolve immediate disputes about violations of traditional resources, or generally remedy the power inequalities of local communities struggling against powerful actors. Customary rights and the recognition of ancestral lands remain important even in the midst of the violent dispossessions that we associate with modernity. Customary identities persist in these resource-dependent settings for the simple fact that identities are linked to geography, even for the nomadic Vezo fishers, and semi-nomadic coastal people of Southwest Madagascar. These issues push the boundaries of what information is needed for good conservation planning. ",
      "Key Findings": "In the DRC, the occupation of the park by armed groups engaged in artisanal mining has led to unprecedented losses of eastern lowland gorillas. Discovery of oil in the species rich Albertine rift region of Uganda created new economic opportunities as well as challenges to the governance of land and biodiversity resources. Madagascar’s coastal and marine biodiversity also plays an important role in the livelihoods and food security of the country.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The applied PEA research identified three themes as indirect drivers of biodiversity loss that should be familiar by now:\n• Patronage networks, which play an important role in the illegal or unregulated acquisition of resources (e.g., fish, land, forest resources, minerals) and abuse of power leaves communities vulnerable to the above drivers;\n• Lack of accountability, which is related to failures of land use planning and security of property (armed occupation in the DRC, elites enabling dispossession of customary landholders in Uganda, and lack of enforcement of existing fishing regulations and coastal zoning in Madagascar); and\n• Criminality related to wildlife trafficking and unsustainable hunting or fishing practices related to and amplified by extractive activities taking place.",

      "Document Title": "USAID Literacy Programs Fact Sheet",
      "Document Summary": "This is the USAID literacy programs fact sheet providing important information about the learning challenges that primary schools in low-income countries are facing and USAID’s response to this. The report highlights that while primary school enrollment has increased significantly in the developing world over the past decade, recent studies show that in many low-income countries very little learning is occurring in the classroom. Most adults who lack basic literacy skills live in developing countries; two-thirds of illiterate adults are women. The fact sheet reveals that literacy rates are directly related to a country’s economic growth. A 10 percent increase in the share of students reaching basic literacy translates into a 0.3 percentage point higher annual growth rate for that country. Literacy also contributes to overall well-being. It has been found that women who participate in literacy programs have better knowledge of health and family planning and are more likely to adopt preventive health measures or seek medical help for themselves or others. ",
      "Key Findings": "Through this case study, we find that illustrative examples of USAID efforts to improve literacy include:\n\n1. The Girls’ Improved Learning Outcomes (GILO) Project in Egypt works to re-energize thousands of teachers by introducing active-learning approaches and enhanced reading instruction.\n\n2. In Liberia, US!ID’s Early Grade Reading Assessment Plus Program engaged more than 10,000 students in grades 2 and 3 and 500 teachers in 180 schools in an effort to improve the teaching of reading.\n\n3. In Mali, where only 23 percent of boys and 10 percent of girls can read a simple sentence in French by the end of grade four, USAID has launched a nationwide Road to Reading program.\n\nAdditionally, USAID is evaluating the use of cellphones, tablets, PDA devices, micro-projectors, and eReaders, among other technologies to improve literacy and learning outcomes.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In support of this goal, USAID is: \n\n- improving reading instruction by strengthening teacher effectiveness, increasing the availability and use of reading materials, and improving school management\n\n- strengthening primary education systems, improving policies, standards and benchmarks for reading\n\n- building parental, community, and private sector engagement in reading improvement efforts\n\nIn all of its efforts to improve reading skills, USAID emphasizes the importance of country-ownership, sustainability, the need for gender-sensitive approaches, the importance of measuring outcomes, and the use of innovative technologies and practices.",

The brief report presents important highlights on how the project is promoting security through the investment in the health of people in Nepal reducing the instability in the post-conflict environment and driving the economic growth that strengthens families, communities, and the country.",
      "Key Findings": "In terms of promoting security, the article states that fighting global disease directly protects the health of citizens around the world because infectious disease knows no borders. U.S. global health programs in Nepal have saved millions of lives, reducing the suffering and hardship caused by disease. Lastly, GHI is making the most of every dollar spent on improving the health of the poorest families around the world, building on unprecedented American global health efforts to achieve broader and more sustainable outcomes while fostering innovation. For an investment of about $10 per person over five years, the U.S. aims to improve the health of 14 million men and women of reproductive age (15 - 45 years of age) and 3 million children.",

      "Document Summary": "Working through a USAID Learning Community for Supply Chain Resilience grant, the Institute of International Agriculture (IITA) and Olam are working together in the Mt. Elgon region in Uganda to develop climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices to help farmers to manage the specific effects of weather variability/ climate change to that region and lay them out in a “stepwise” pathway tailored to specific farmer segments to help them make a smarter and more timely investment in resilience-building practices. “Improving coffee sector climate-smart awareness and decision-making” draws important lessons from this collaborative effort. ",
      "Key Findings": "The lessons documented in this report are drawn from the nature of agricultural practices that helped farmers to manage the effects of weather variability/climate change particular to a certain area (in this case, the Mount Elgon region), the way that the companies helped to enable farmers to make smarter and more timely investments in their farms, the way companies promoted the adoption of practices among farmer partners that helped them to build resilience to climate change for a particular sourcing area, the way that the companies better understand their farmers, and the way these companies most efficiently and effectively invested limited resources in different “types of farmers.”\n\nThe report highlights that the farmer segmentation to understand farmers’ motivation, ability, and desire to invest in practices, stepwise program development & training to improve uptake of climate-smart agriculture among farmers, and creation of demonstration plots for “stepwise” practices to understand CSA practices for coffee in specific geographies were some of the practices that were introduced from the learning purposes. Based on these pilot interventions and learning from them this report discusses the sustainability dimension of the intervention; barriers to private sector engagement with NGO partners and learning from the private sector engagement; and potential incentives that can attract the private sector to make an investment in the sector.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Olam as a company has a particular set of characteristics that enable its decision-makers to invest in innovations for longer-term sustainability. As a direct service provider, it is interested in on-the-ground, real-time information and analytics that can translate into yield and quality gains for its farmers, and cost reductions through more efficient delivery.\n\nCompany wide commitment enables decision-makers to innovate in\nthis space.\n\nImportance of a leader/champion within the company that pushes for sustainability and understands the value that development partners can bring.",

      "Document Summary": "This short brief highlights how to structure climate science for a company’s specific sourcing footprint, the challenge of finding resources for combating climate change, and the complexity of working with smallholder farmers. In this brief, an effort has been put in place to understand the risk being posed by the climate to the agriculture supply chain including erratic rainfall, which leads to crop loss and soil erosion. This causes flooding and the re-planting of crops, which leads to small farmers’ ability to adopt these changes due to poor investment capacity of small farmers and future supply risk among the next generation as a major threat to their supply chain. \n\nTo address some of these challenges, TechnoServe and SFL used the Guide to Assessing Climate Resilience in Smallholder Supply Chains to structure NBL’s climate risk assessment following the step-by-step process to know the risk, farmers, resilience, and how to build resilience, and monitoring the progress. The report presents the results of risks and made recommendations to build resilience for both barley and sorghum. The report also highlights the typical barriers to private sector investment, a multi-stakeholder approach to address the risk, company characteristics that favor investment in CSA, and entry points to facilitate investment.",
      "Key Findings": "Typical barriers to private sector investment: A company’s need to deliver short term profits can be a barrier to investment in longer-term climate action, even when it is apparent that it is necessary.\n\nMulti-stakeholder approach: In the case of NBL in Uganda, resilience requires building human, social, financial, natural and physical capital among the farming communities.\n\nCompany characteristics that favor investment in CSA: Companies who already have some knowledge around climate risk are easiest to engage in climate smart agriculture.\n\nEntry points to facilitate investment: By creating lessons that are useful but simple, NGO’s can show the need to adapt for climate resilience.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Coordinate with Uganda Met and potentially commercial suppliers to install additional weather stations\n• Pursue partnerships with providers of forecasting information allowing dissemination to all providers\n• Support development of enabling environment (e.g. set up co-investment committee with other interested parties such as coffee growers in Mount Elgon area to develop weather station and communication infrastructure)\n• Invest in further extension activities to help farmers understand need, best use, and see benefit from improved seed\n• Explore partnerships for input-credit model to reach farmers directly or via aggregators",

This case also highlights the challenge of private sector actors to justify resource use to combat climate change and the complexity of working with smallholder farmers. The report concludes with the key findings of the assessment and the recommendations to build resilience against climate change.  ",
      "Key Findings": "Not only are NBL’s supply chains complex, they also have incidence of low human, social, financial, natural and physical capital, making them vulnerable to climate change. This article suggests that beyond financial capacity, building resilience will require engagement with other stakeholders. Taking on these challenges will require financial capacity and long-term planning and  Finding a company champion who has the time and influence is crucial to success.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. The engagement between AB InBev, the Sustainable Food Lab and TechnoServe grew out of long term, trusted relationships.\n\n2. Having a competent implementation partner like TechnoServe, able to both manage local researchers and structure findings for a business audience, was another critical element of success.\n\n3. By creating lessons that were useful but simple, TechnoServe was able to create a better understanding of the need for climate investments.\n\n4. To drive results, companies with long term thinking are more well\nequipped to take on climate-smart agriculture as a way to mitigate risk.",

      "Key Findings": "In light of the need for humanitarian organizations to have adequate security for their operations, private security companies are now filling the void left by state forces. Little analysis, however, has been made of the impact of private security companies on the delivery of post-Cold War humanitarian assistance. To make this analysis, the article considers the changes in humanitarian activity, the relevant services offered by private security providers, the differing issues relating to legitimacy factors and financial and political implications, and the state of the mechanisms capable of bringing about positive change in the relationship between private security companies and humanitarian organizations. In the main, the article asserts that reliance on the private security option as currently endowed, organized, and managed, while pragmatic and not without its benefits, is a highly problematic solution for\nhumanitarians.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Humanitarians must operate in a state system not amenable for their moral consternation. Pragmatic solutions such as Private Security Companies-Humanitarian relationship are what set the dividing line between activity or inactivity, doing something or doing nothing at all. However, while not mutually exclusive, this favors stability over conflict resolution, protection over good governance. Private Security Companies are an option for humanitarians, but the difficulties, and their potential for amelioration, must be acknowledged in the first instance. ",

      "Key Findings": "This report looks at two aspects of economic globalisation: foreign private sector investment and the privatisation of basic services. Each\nrepresents an increased level of involvement of the private sector in the lives of children, and each raises serious concerns in respect of\nchildren’s rights.\nForeign investment is often heralded as one of the great benefits of globalisation for poorer communities. At its best, such investment can\nprovide new opportunities to young people and their families not just through direct employment but also through linkages to the local economy.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In light of the concerns outlined in this report, Save the Children UK is making three sets of recommendations in order to help make globalisation work in the interests of children, not against them:\n• a binding international framework for corporate accountability, including\ninternational standards on corporate practice, financial and operational transparency, and effective monitoring and liability mechanisms\n• a reversal of the current trend towards deregulation of investment, and a revision of international investment agreements in order to restore national capacity to regulate foreign investors effectively in pursuit of national development goals\n• a thoroughgoing review of the commitment to increased privatisation of basic services in institutions such as the World Bank.",

      "Document Summary": "This report is a highlight of public-private partnerships that support CSR creating mutual benefits for all stakeholders. While contributing to the success of social, environmental, and health programs, public-private partnerships also have the potential to have a positive impact on business. In this context of growing interest in CSR, the Academy for Educational Development (AED) and ExxonMobil (EM) developed a synergistic partnership through the NetMark (NM) project, building on each partner’s comparative advantage to protect vulnerable populations from malaria while building a sustainable commercial insecticide-treated mosquito net (ITN) market. The production, promotion, and distribution of ITNs using vouchers, the coordination with public health and retail networks, and an overarching need to design a cost-effective and scalable model targeting pregnant women with subsidized ITNs are the key elements of this partnership. The article also highlights both potential and achieved benefits for the two partners regarding CSR.",
      "Key Findings": "The report further emphasizes that this partnership enables the establishment of a cost-effective model for large-scale subsidies on ITNs for vulnerable populations and contributes to the expansion of the local commercial sector in establishing a far-reaching distribution network that can be maintained without the need for ongoing donor funding. Human resources are developing their skills in malaria prevention and in working with non-profit organizations, bridging the gap between profit and non-profit sectors. By demonstrating the feasibility and appropriateness of the RBM ITN framework, NetMark technical assistance is more and more solicited in global ITN discussions and/or replication of such interventions. USAID, NetMark’s major financial partner strongly recommends such an approach that builds on public-private partnerships. In this partnership, the initiative is built upon an existing public-private partnership with ITN producers and distributors working with national public health systems and was introduced as part of an overall strategy and process of building a sustainable market for ITNs in Africa. Building on this favorable environment, the development of an innovative model is being promoted and replicated by the NetMark-ExxonMobil Partnership but also other malaria actors. \n\nFinally, the report warns that there are no one-size-fits-all mechanisms of CSR that can be applied in each country or to each partner. Each situation must be considered in its own context considering the local geopolitical environment and available resources, but also in-country relationships established at the institutional and programmatic levels.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This report suggests considering the following factors while scaling-up of this partnership model using vouchers to target pregnant women with ITNs:\n•  The policy support at the national level for the expansion of the model in the national public health systems\n•  The long-term commitment of ExxonMobil or other financial mechanisms such as the Global Fund to subsidize ITNs for pregnant women through the voucher approach\n•  The financial and organizational capabilities of the production and distribution partners in providing the required ITN availability and geographic accessibility.",

      "Document Title": "Control of tuberculosis in an urban setting in Nepal: public-private partnership",
      "Document Summary": "This document provides key findings for the feasibility of implementing a public-private partnership for control of TB. It highlights that NGOs often show strengths in community involvement and advocacy. By combining the strengths of private practitioners, NGOs, and the public sector, public-private partnerships can provide services that give very high treatment success rates and increased case notification rates. It argues that a public-private partnership is not a static entity but continues to evolve to meet the changing strengths, weaknesses, and commitment of private practitioners, nongovernmental organizations, and the NTP.\n\nThis report concludes with a word of warning saying that a public-private partnership for the control of TB should be considered only when a country’s national TB program is strong. The public sector must take long-term overall responsibility for public health and needs to show commitment to ensuring that standards of care are maintained and to react quickly when problems arise. If the public sector is weak, a public-private partnership may encourage the private sector to expand the provision of TB services that have low patient retention and cure rates, thus threatening public health and potentially weakening the public sector still further.",
      "Key Findings": "In the first 36 months, 1328 patients with TB were registered in the public-private partnership. Treatment success rates were >90%, and <1% of patients defaulted. Case notification of sputum-positive patients in the study area increased from 54 per 100 000 to 102 per 100 000. The numbers of patients with TB started on treatment by private practitioners decreased by more than two-thirds, the number of private pharmacies that stocked anti-TB drugs by one-third, the number of pharmacies selling anti-TB drugs by almost two-thirds, and sales of anti-TB drugs in pharmacies by almost two-thirds. Private practitioners were happy to refer patients to the public-private partnership. Not all private practitioners had to be involved: many patients bypassed private practitioners and went directly to free DOTS centres.\nA combination of the strengths of private practitioners, nongovernmental organizations, and the public sector in a public private partnership can be used to provide a service that is liked by patients and gives high rates of treatment success and increased rates of patient notification. Similar public-private partnerships are likely to be replicable elsewhere, as inputs are not large and no special requirements exist.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on learning from Nepal’s experience, the report encourages other nongovernmental organizations or private clinics to become DOTS centers which should further improve patient access and enable the public-private partnership to continue should some partners withdraw.

      "Document Summary": "With the very normative question of whether increased private sector influence is inherently good or bad, the world is experiencing the privatization of multilateral institutions as a result of a financial crisis. In view of this, this document emphasizes the importance of complementing discussions of the efficient effects of private sector influence and the normative issues in which the critics engage, with a focus on power, legitimacy, and authority in the multilateral system. ",
      "Key Findings": "In this article, we have emphasized the importance of complementing discussions of the efficiency effects of private sector influence and the normative issues in which the critics engage, with a focus on power, legitimacy, and authority in the multilateral system. It is then not selfevident that increased private sector participation necessarily leads to a weakening of the multilateral institutions. It may also strengthen the role of the institutions as actors in the global system. In particular, this is likely to be the case for multilateral institutions that are able to assume the role of nodal points in complex networks of governance emerging from the multitude of private-public partnerships now being developed. Increased private sector participation may indeed be a strategy by default, as it was developed against the background of insufficient funding from member states. But at the same time, it should be seen as a deliberate—and perhaps successful—attempt by the multilateral institutions to regain relevance precisely by placing them at center stage in a new structure of world governance based on public private partnerships organized along the lines of overlapping networks of governance.

      "Document Summary": "This paper draws on innovation, business, and organization literature to highlight some of the approaches that were used in revitalizing African Agriculture through innovative business models and organizational arrangements: promising developments in the traditional crops sector. Mainly, the document focuses on three concepts: value innovation, lead user focus, and organizational value logic. ",
      "Key Findings": "Accordingly, it has highlighted the limitations of business and organizational models that have governed African agriculture and its R&D systems over the last 40 years. It has shown that the lack or neglect of business-competitive approaches has undermined value creation, at least in the traditional crops sector, to the detriment of the competitiveness of African agriculture. It has also shown that innovative organizational arrangements and business models can help create new market space and value addition for African agricultural products, for example by responding to the needs of a variety of user communities.\n\nIt must be emphasized that many of the ‘successes’ highlighted here are scattered and isolated pilot schemes established mainly through ‘donor-driven trends,’ notably including participatory and pluralistic research and extension approaches and competitive grants systems that have encouraged a number of public-private–civil society partnerships. The challenge of institutionalizing these approaches, wholly or in part, and up-scaling and out-scaling the scattered successes remains. This paper does not claim to have the solution to this challenge. But one lesson that can be derived from the case studies presented here is the need for the paradigmatic shift in the way agricultural R&D systems in Africa are conceived and the way they themselves conceive of their customers or user communities. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "This paper argues that business-organizational issues in African agriculture merit urgent and high-level attention. One important implication for Africa is the need for the private sector to re-think its customer logic by viewing the poor, who constitute a majority of the African population, as potentially their most important customers. Such a revaluation of business logic may facilitate private sector ‘buy-in’, not only in institutionalizing business-competitive approaches but also in up-scaling and out-scaling scattered successes in African agriculture.",

      "Key Findings": "Key findings from the research show that business engagement in humanitarian relief has expanded in scope and size in recent years – in both voluntary and commercial ways. A range of factors, the most prominent of which are to contribute to positive branding and to motivate staff, drives companies to engage in humanitarian work. Companies wishing to pursue partnership arrangements tend to prefer in-kind assistance to cash aid. The vast majority of engagement relates to natural disaster relief, however, and the value of such engagements in financial terms remains small, relative to overall humanitarian financing. Perceptions of a growing trend of non-commercial company engagement in humanitarian relief may be based largely on effective public relations/brand management campaigns by companies involved in this field. The widely held perception that companies increasingly compete on a commercial basis with traditional humanitarian actors seems overstated. This perception may have been influenced by the highly publicised instances of corporations receiving large USAID contracts during the Afghan and Iraq wars. To date, commercial business engagement seems to be largely limited to reconstruction and long-term development.\n\nPartnerships with businesses can bring needed technical expertise and added capacity – but developing a strong working relationship takes time and effort. Past attempts to pursue partnerships with corporate agencies have often been frustrated as agencies are unclear about the intended outcomes for the partnership or view it as a way of developing a long-term funding arrangement. Partner selection should be based on a match between identified gaps, the skills and capacities on offer and the ability of the agency to manage the partnership. Equally, companies should seek not to limit themselves to natural disasters or high-profile cases – positive image is based on credibility and, in the long run, responding to greatest need will contribute more to such credibility than opportunistic efforts. Finally, companies should be more transparent about the contributions they make to humanitarian relief. Research in this area is hampered by companies’ reluctance to provide privileged information, irrespective of whether their engagement is based on a commercial or non-commercial model.",

      "Document Title": "The Economics of Emergency Response",
      "Key Findings": "Federal first responder funding is estimated to be $98 billion below the minimum required level over the 5 years ending in 2010. A significant portion of that shortfall can be covered by savings attained by eliminating non-public-good services, initiating public–private partnerships for meeting peak time demand in emergency situations, and contracting-out other public services. We concentrate on such savings in the context of response to false calls to police, fire, and ambulance services. Solving the false alarm problem for police, fire, and ambulance services and eliminating some non-public-good police services could release significant service-hours and 23.7–31.4% of the required additional Homeland Security (HLS) annual spending. Reducing false alarms means 88,000 police, fire, and ambulance first responders could be shifted to HLS activities.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This paper suggested that social welfare in the provision of emergency services could improve if government sheds services that are private in nature and contracts out services that could be improved under market conditions. Market conditions include local governments competing along with private entities. This solution does not consider the possibility that some individual cases could be better served through government provision. For example, charging all callers for ambulance service could harm those individuals that will not call for service. Also, efficient solutions will not necessarily produce equitable solutions. In fact, reliance on markets could yield situations where the conditions for the poor worsen and may suggest adoption of compensation schemes. The question is the\nextent of such undesired consequences. Clearly, a detailed empirical study is necessary to test both whether efficiency conditions indeed prevail and to measure the extent of any\ninequity consequences.",

      "Key Findings": "Any role for business can only complement other elements of a peace process, and should not be seen as distinct. While businesspeople can, and often should, be strategic partners in a peace process, they cannot be the sole agents of change. Businesses are, in theory, able to act where others sometimes cannot. However, when business is seen as acting according to self-interest, its intervention can be counter-productive. In conflicts where economic factors predominate, and where changing the current power structure, including entrenched economic interests, is a matter high on the agenda of some of the warring parties, the role of business will be viewed with suspicion. The private sector's close involvement, particularly financing of peace initiatives, can easily skew the outcome to favor an economic model that the business community prefers, but which may not have consensus support across the society. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Including private-sector positions, interests, and needs in conflict analyses\n\n- Assessing risk: how likely will private-sector involvement impact the peace process?\n\n- Potential impact on a mediator's own legitimacy and ability to work with the parties\n\n- balancing values and pragmatism\n\n- early awareness raising, outreach, and involvement\n\n- clarifying ways of working and division of labour\n\n- what role? each context has a different role for private sector to play",

In addition, recent changes in intellectual property (IP), industrial, trade, and regulatory policies have caused Indian and Chinese companies to move farther up the value chain by investing in innovative research and entering new and wealthier markets. This paper examines the successful business models of first-generation and local biotech companies in India and China. It has then explored the sustainability of these models in the context of today’s evolving global biotechnology markets. ",
      "Key Findings": "India and China have made major progress toward establishing research- and innovation-based health biotechnology sectors. Local health needs, including diseases that predominantly affect the poor, have driven much of this success. We argue that emerging domestic firms can play an important role as reliable and high-quality suppliers of existing products and as innovators for global health needs. Indeed, these firms’ participation may make existing global health approaches more sustainable. However, global health stakeholders, including international donors and the Indian and Chinese governments, will need to fashion incentives for these companies to retain a strategic focus on the global poor.\n",

      "Document Title": "China’s Private Enterprises in Africa and the Implications for African Development",
      "Document Summary": "This paper has evaluated the growing presence of China’s private business sector in Africa. Currently, attention focuses on China’s State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in extractive industries. Less attention is paid to Chinese private enterprises. Conventional wisdom about China’s investment in Africa holds that it is largely resource-focused, conducted by large SOEs, and driven by Chinese State interests rather than market forces. The evidence of the practical realities of Chinese private companies in Africa beyond the resources sector presents a different picture. This study has shown the established view to be one-dimensional and thus significantly flawed as a general explanation of China’s role and impact in Africa. Consequently, the actual developmental role and impact of Chinese investment are often either misunderstood or misrepresented.\n\nIt requires a greater understanding of the relationship between the Chinese public authorities, mainly the Chinese government, and China’s private sector. This study has sought to contribute to the stock of knowledge on this relationship by evaluating the characteristics and motivations of Chinese private firms in Africa and assessing development implications. In addressing this, this study posed three central questions: (i) ‘What are the principal characteristics and trends of Chinese private investment and Chinese enterprises in Africa?’ (ii) ‘Who or what is driving this investment and the outward expansion by Chinese private enterprises – the Chinese authorities or China’s increasingly strong private entrepreneurs?’ (iii) ‘What are the implications of this growing private sector presence for African development?’ ",
      "Key Findings": "Key findings are that the Chinese private firms have followed their own paths to Africa, and the primary factors driving private investment are African market opportunities, competition within China and the presence of a strong entrepreneurial spirit. An effective mechanism bridging a gap between China’s African Policy and its implementation in terms of private sector engagement is lacking. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "To maximise development gains, a top-down and bottom-up ‘two-way street’ approach to Chinese public–private sector relations is necessary. This is a mutual learning process for the Chinese public and private sectors and also China–Africa relations. These are fluid relationships with each adapting to and shaping the other.",

      "Key Findings": "The results of this study show that business contributions to disaster relief can constitute functional supplements to disaster recovery operations, but in the short and mid- term perspective will only complement, not replace, public sector and civil society efforts. The analysis underlines two aspects: by definition business contributions, be they commercial or non-commercial, do not fully comply with the fundamental humanitarian principles of impartiality, independence and humanity. Yet, if ground rules for non-commercial business engagement can be established, then the potential contribution of business can be realized in natural disaster recovery. If properly crafted, partnerships with corporate actors can significantly contribute to improved\nhumanitarian aid operations on the ground by providing additional financial and non-financial resources, thus making humanitarian aid more effective and, at times, more efficient.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Establish a Standing Multi- Stakeholder Committee on Humanitarian Assistance: Procedures have to be set up that facilitate the effective and efficient channelling of corpo-\nrate funds, goods and services to the benefit of the people in need in the aftermath of a natural disaster. Based on the finding that most non- profit and profit actors do not know each other and are simply overworked in times of natural disasters, a stakeholder committee and a contact point should be set up. This committee should consist of all relevant parties (business representatives, civil society representatives, donor representatives, plus other experts). In regular working meetings, workshops, etc., best practice and lessons learnt about past natural disasters will be exchanged, discussing, among other things, the pros and cons of business involvement. The debate on business involvement should not be restricted to monetary donations, but should also focus on core competencies of companies, including goods and services needed in the aftermath of natural disasters. \n2. Create a Business-Donor Consensus on Humanitarian Assistance:A common framework for non- commercial business engagement in disaster relief operations should be devised to define common objectives and outline suitable business interpretations of fundamental humanitarian principles.\n3. Ensure Policy Coherence in Natural Disaster Response: Public actors, such as international organizations and governments, should seek to build synergies among their various institutions involved in the area of disaster relief, in line with the LRRD (linking relief, rehabilitation and development) approach. Business engagement in disaster response constitutes a cross- cutting issue that includes many different public actors with varying expertise on the inclusion of corporate actors. Public actors, such as the EU, should\ntherefore mainstream disaster preparedness in their development programs in order to make disaster response more effective and close the gap between humanitarian assistance, development aid and corporate engagement.",

      "Key Findings": "The U.S. Government views business as a legitimate player in humanitarian assistance, in part because USAID must work with businesses in order to meet its legal requirements as laid out in the Federal Assistance Regulations and Buy America Act. However, there is also a belief that by increasing donor capacity to deliver aid, business engagement may further the commitment to the world’s neediest. The European Commission on the other hand does not involve business in the direct provision of assistance due to institutional barriers preventing DG ECHO from funding anything but NGOs and the UN, and because of a strict understanding of the humanitarian principles precluding economic interests in influencing aid. As these conceptions are based on principles and assumptions rather than measured evidence and conclusions, a change in policy on either side of the Atlantic will require a shift in conceptions of assistance and how it should be delivered and governed.

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Emphasize Informal Cooperation, Strengthen Multilateral Channels,and Hold High- Level Bilateral Discussions\n2. Improve the Capacity of Humanitarian Donors to Implement Lessons\n3. Decide on Desirability of LRRD. If Desirable, Strategically Define Opportunities and Develop Better Methods to Link Relief, Rehabilitation, and Development\n4. Maximize Business Contributions to Humanitarian Assistance,\nWhile Minimizing Their Risks\n5.Address Normative Problems of Civil- Military Interaction\nand Improve Operational Approaches",

      "Document Title": "A New Business Model for Humanitarian Assistance? A Challenge Paper ",
      "Key Findings": "We believe that the international community needs a new vulnerability and protection business model. This new model should have six requirements:\n1. A comprehensive risk framework;\n2. A reworked balance of spending between response, prevention and recovery;\n3. A big investment in national and local capacity;\n4. Fuller engagement of the private sector;\n5. Linking of the humanitarian to broader social and economic development issues; and\n6. Regional and international readiness to address cross-border \nhumanitarian issues.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. A comprehensive risk framework: \n• Undertake a broad consultative process at the international and national levels to define vulnerability factors and an agreed-upon methodology for measurement and reporting of these factors.\n• Conduct a system-wide assessment of response capacities available at all levels: international, regional, national, and sub-national, including local humanitarian actors as well as non-traditional actors such as the private sector.\n• Establish systems for the collection, monitoring, analysis and dissemination of data on vulnerability factors and response capacity.\n• Facilitate a multi-stakeholder process at the international and national levels to develop models to analyse this raw data and calculate risk levels, initially at the national level with an eye to eventually having sub-national risk calculations.\n• Conduct regularised development of risk-management strategy using these risk measurements on an individual actor level as well as across the humanitarian sector.\n• Review and revise the resulting comprehensive risk-management frameworks on a regular basis.\n\n2. Reworking the balance of spending between prevention, response and recovery:\n• Establish a clean accountancy of funds that are spent in the three categories and those that are already integrated. This process should include a comprehensive definition of prevention, response and recovery and include sources not traditionally included as humanitarian assistance.\n• Undertake a full-scale review of current practice. The direct providers of humanitarian assistance should critically evaluate how they currently deliver humanitarian assistance across the three categories and look for redundancy both within their own systems and with other providers.\n• Design integrated plans – both between categories and donors. At present, many relevant stakeholders are compartmentalised and focus solely on prevention, response or recovery. Firm moves should be made to remedy this situation. Countries should be encouraged to fully integrate risk-reduction practices in all aspects of society and the economy.\n• The international community should identify and engage in a limited number of preventive humanitarian assistance programmes targeted at areas of high risk and vulnerability.\n\n3. A big investment in national and local capacity:\n• Develop comprehensive plans for building humanitarian capacity through a multi-stakeholder collaborative process, including local and national governments, international organisations, national and international NGOs, donors, and other relevant actors such as the private sector.\n• In alignment with such a comprehensive plan, conduct targeted national and local capacity-building investment activities to further develop the models and policies required to bring these activities to scale. These efforts should adhere to the following characteristics:\n- Ensure local ownership of efforts;\n- Be focused on high-risk countries;\n- Work at both the policy and practical level; and\n- Be designed with the aim of being replicable in other contexts.\n\n4. Fuller engagement of the private sector:\n• Further develop pro-bono collaborations, and particularly multi company commitments, across the various industries with skills and expertise relevant to humanitarian action needs.\n• Collaborate with relevant private-sector actors to further develop tools to measure and communicate results as well as understand and evaluate performance.\n• Further develop the policies and models required to facilitate and catalyse deeper private-sector engagement as investors in post-conflict and post-crisis contexts, as well as in efforts to reduce vulnerability in high-risk areas.\n\n5. Linking the humanitarian with broader social and economic development issues:\n• The humanitarian response to a crisis should be conceived based on context analysis and needs assessments. Inclusion of appropriate economic, social, and political context analyses determines whether the response is relevant and adequate.\n• In recent years, observers have insisted that humanitarian actors perform a due diligence effort before embarking on their humanitarian activities. The “do no harm” approach applied to economic and social factors should be an in-built effort in the design of humanitarian\noperations. Only through applying due diligence can humanitarians avoid playing a counterproductive role and, unwittingly, hamper or delay recovery.\n• Sustainability must now become a fundamental feature of humanitarian action. Humanitarians must strive to protect livelihoods as well as feed hungry people. This marks a shift in terms of approach and approximates a development long-term approach. Undoubtedly, such an approach is more labour intensive, less visible and less susceptible for (humanitarian) donor attention. Yet, it is an essential prerequisite for sustainability.\n\n6. Regional and international readiness to address cross-border humanitarian issues:\n• Where established regional and sub-regional organisations have functioning secretariats – e.g., OSCE, AU, ECOWAS, ASEAN – it is both worthwhile and feasible for them to establish specialist units to lead implementation of this five-point agenda.\n• There is also a case for the establishment of specialised capacities such as the Nile Basin Initiative. A similar agency might be established jointly by India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. The function of these agencies is to assure readiness. That means, starting from the risk assessment and identifying actors able and available to join in regional humanitarian\nefforts, being able to mobilise resources quickly as need arises – financial resources from international funds and bilateral donors, and human resources primarily from the region but, where there are deficiencies in capacity, also from further afield.\n• These efforts as a whole should be coordinated by UN OCHA for optimum effect and efficiency.\n\n\n\n",

      "Document Title": "Business to the rescue: private sector actors and global environmental regimes’ legitimacy",
      "Document Summary": "This article aims at (1) assessing the extent to which the decision of Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) decision VIII/17 might reverse the CBD’s legitimacy crisis and (2) analyzing the issues at stake when private sector actors are involved in environmental regimes. In order to do so, the article analyses the consequences of decision VIII/17 in terms of internal—representation and transparency—and external—institutional efficiency and implementation—legitimacy. The study is based on extended empirical scrutiny of the negotiations linked to decision VIII/17. While adopting a general conceptualization of legitimacy, the value added by the study is to broaden the usual understanding of business strategies for environmental issues. In particular, this article shows how decision VIII/17 has generated several reactions—defensive as well as proactive—among the business community. At the practical level, the article proposes several recommendations to secure constructive participation of all categories of business actors in biodiversity governance. At the theoretical level, it calls for a change in deterministic visions of economic actors’ interests. In particular, this article examines the following research questions: (1) to what extent might decision VIII/17 reduce the legitimacy crisis of the CBD, and (2) which issues are at stake in the inclusion of private sector actors in environmental regimes? In order to deal with these two research objectives, the article conducts an empirical analysis of the consequences of decision VIII/17 in terms of the CBD’s internal and external legitimacy.",
      "Key Findings": "The analysis of decision VIII/17 of the CBD on the further involvement of the private sector in the Convention leads to two results. First, it suggests some recommendations to strengthen the legitimacy of the CBD. Second, the case study sheds some light on two current theoretical debates in environmental governance: the link between private initiatives and intergovernmental regimes and the question of business strategies toward environmental issues. This article also demonstrates the need to better conceptualize the interactions between private and public governance systems. Moreover, the involvement of a broader range of enterprises, such as small and middle-sized companies from developing countries, is needed to achieve the CBD objectives. The analysis also reveals the importance of considering the broad diversity of business interests interacting with environmental governance. This article highlights how decision VIII/17 creates several dynamics inside the business community. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The analysis enables us to draw some practical recommendations on the legitimacy of the CBD. The further involvement of private sector actors can potentially play an important role in filling two of legitimacy’s deficits in the current biodiversity regime: the representativeness of its decision-making as well as the implementation of its principles. It is a positive step towards the inclusion of actors that have been mainly indifferent or obstructive so far. Moreover, the diversity of business skills and positions, when mobilised constructively, could represent a rich tool towards more biodiversity preservation.",

      "Document Summary": "This study analyzes the transformation of urban water services in China since the late 1990s focusing on the interaction between the government and private players in the form of public-private partnership projects. A couple of issues such as a lack of funds, outdated technologies and management skills, and underpriced water tariffs had deteriorated urban water services in China. To address this issue, Chinese authorities decided to adopt private sector participation in the urban water sector which attracted private players to contribute to public-private partnership projects. Water multinationals and Chinese companies actively participated in such new development. But myriads of risks were identified in the Chinese water market, including socio-political, institutional, regulatory, revenue and foreign exchange, and project construction and operation risks. The report further highlights that the key to the success of this policy shift depends on the extent to which Chinese authorities can provide an institutional platform for the improvement of urban water services with the participation of private players. Also, the changing role of the government from a service provider to a regulator is necessary.",

      "Document Summary": "This paper explains the use of cost-benefit analysis for the evaluation of global public-private partnerships that combine international intergovernmental organizations with national governments, businesses, and the non-profit organizations of civil society. Cost-benefit analysis can identify and compare the social and private costs and benefits of the projects, thereby identifying cases where global public-private partnerships will provide socially desirable results when markets alone will not. Cost-benefit analysis can assess the necessity and the sufficiency of strategies proposed by the partnerships. The paper discusses modifications to the cost-benefit analysis required for its use in evaluations of global public-private partnerships, explaining the need for market-centered valuations but also explaining the role of alternative social valuations.",
      "Key Findings": "Based on the investigation and analysis, the paper concludes that the policies of a national government and international intergovernmental organizations working through global public-private partnerships and market-centered social valuations of the present values of the streams of consumer surplus and producer surplus generated by the market system are not independent; thus, public policies can redirect economic resources to promote socially desirable economic activity. The analyses identify cases of market failure and point to the cases that global public-private partnerships can usefully address and provide tools for both prospective and retrospective evaluation of projects.",

Each paper focuses on different themes. The forward of the book under review details a case illustration of Indus Entrepreneur (TiE) Boston USA, which explains how social entrepreneurship can be encouraged and what measures are required to develop a public-private partnership. The book has provided an illustration of Pratham, a leading Indian NGO, as an example, which developed unique pedagogy for the basic skills in primary education and developed the typical model to recruit and train teachers. Another success story in social entrepreneurship is SEWA which started in 1972. This is a noble concept of unionizing women in the unorganized sector and seeks to promote resources for empowerment, finance, and health. The other chapter of this book illustrates the success story of the Deshpande Foundation, an American philanthropy organization focused on agriculture, education, livelihood, health, and globalization. There is also MIT's Deshpande Centre for Technological Innovation that produces knowledge in the area of biotechnology, information technology, nanotechnology, and environmental innovations. The Sandbox for innovation is a laboratory for evolving the best practices. ",
      "Key Findings": "In another illustration, the opportunities for social entrepreneurship in the profit-centered industry are highlighted. The success story of Wainright Bank and Trust company provides insight into a diverse range of social and environmental initiatives. Yet another study highlights the approach to environmental sustainability-managing stakeholders through education. It highlights the frameworks of environmental reporting and disclosures. Another case study highlights the role of clean technology. The study provides information on the sources of clean technology. A chapter examines the sustainability practices in India and provides useful information on certain institutions operating in this field.",

      "Document Summary": "This article begins by highlighting the evidence for “business that can help alleviate poverty and can do so in ways that add value to the bottom line.” This is not especially strong, particularly if the business is thought of as a development agent, i.e., an organization that consciously and accountable contributes toward pro-poor outcomes. By exploring the experiences of producers of Fairtrade tea in Kenya, this article articulates the complex nature of what constitutes a beneficial outcome for the poor and marginalized and the gap that can exist between ethical intentions and the experience of their intended beneficiaries. ",
      "Key Findings": "This article suggests that the promises made by CSR need to be treated with caution. First, it is a claim based on scant systematic evidence, and where justification has been sought, this is more likely to take the form of a business case for engaging in poverty alleviation than a case for why the poor should welcome business participation as a development agent. Second, it presents empirical data and illustrates examples from Aruka, Kenya to show the CSR ethical purpose and differences that can lie between what an ethically driven initiative seeks to achieve and its benefit to the community. \n\nThe evidence in this article describes Fairtrade as something paternalistic, partially reminiscent of preceding approaches to development going back to the colonial era.",

      "Key Findings": "Each of the previous possible solutions are attempts to repair fundamental disconnect between the public and private sectors using creative solutions based on either market or non-market solutions. With the NRF guidelines for private sector emergency response, the public sector resource crunch and the blossoming of a powerful private sector that relies on government contracting, the use of a private contract model in disaster response is likely to continue. The model likely creates efficiencies by pushing supply operations to the most efficient and experienced private organizations. However, the model also creates vulnerabilities that should be addressed before complete reliance on the private sector in emergency response activities",
      "Key Recommendations": "For disaster response systems to work effectively and efficiently the public and private sectors will likely have to address some of the challenges posed by the public–private contract model, whether they do so in one of the ways suggested by this paper or an alternative method. There may simply be a fundamental problem in the emergency context—everything is unanticipated—that makes private contractual ordering difficult, but the public sector’s inability to meet all of the citizen’s needs during a disaster makes the public–private contract an integral part of response planning and coordination. This is just one facet of the challenge of designing less vulnerable and more foolproof response systems",

      "Document Summary": "Within the complex ecosystem of domestic governments, international donors, private businesses, and individual philanthropists, the emerging model of social entrepreneurship offers potential as one model to address the multi-sectoral challenges young people face in the Middle East. This report draws on existing literature to focus on four central principles of social entrepreneurship. They are; i) achievements of positive social impact, ii) non-conventional thinking, iii) use of sustainable methods, and iv) innovation that can be adapted and “scaled up” beyond the local context. This report draws analysis from the focused group with 78 globally recognized and awarded social entrepreneurs with the intent to examine trends and patterns. ",
      "Key Findings": "Social entrepreneurship is emerging as one model to support youth development and employment in the Middle East while also tackling some of the region's other long-term development challenges, according to a new Middle East Youth Initiative-Silatech report.\n\nAccordingly, the report has drawn the seven common characteristics that exist among social entrepreneurs: i) They are a highly educated group, with most of them having attained university degrees and post-graduate degrees; ii) As children and youth, most of these individuals were engaged in extracurricular activities, including sports, the arts, and youth organizations; iii) a third of this group has studied, lived, or worked abroad and cites their experience abroad as a factor that has shaped their professional aspirations, most of them have an intimate understanding of or personal experience with the problems they are trying to solve; iv) A majority of them are pursuing systemic change, with many reaching out to governments to achieve wide-reaching impact; v) They are pioneering new areas of focus, service delivery methods, or products across a wide range of sectors; and vii) Due to issues of organizational and funding priorities, 73 out of the 78 internationally recognized social entrepreneurs are drawn from only five countries in the region: Egypt, the West Bank and Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, and Morocco.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The report highlights that social entrepreneurs in the Middle East are facing three broad categories of challenges, they are; i) Policymaking and governance-related challenges; ii) The need for greater institutional, operational, and financial support, and iii) The lack of social and cultural awareness and recognition of their work. To address some of these challenges, the report has offered a list of recommendations that are directed toward multiple institutions and stakeholders across regional and local levels. Key recommendations are; i) Clearly define social entrepreneurship in the Middle East; ii) Standardize benchmarks for measuring social and environmental returns and impact, iii) Support incubators and seed funds targeting youth-led social enterprise start-ups; iv) Assess the feasibility of national replication funds; v) Set up a regional social investment forum for scaling up youth initiatives; vi) Improve coordination of multistakeholder efforts; vii) Convene national and regional policy dialogues on legal frameworks, and ix) Strengthen the demand for and the culture of social entrepreneurship among youth and communities.",

      "Document Title": "Public–private partnerships and developing-country agriculture: Evidence from the international agricultural research system",
      "Document Summary": "This study report explains the role of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in promoting pro-poor productivity-enhancing technological innovation in the international agricultural research system. The study examines the extent to which PPPs are being used to overcome market and institutional failures that otherwise inhibit the development and dissemination of technologies targeted specifically to small-scale, resource-poor farmers in developing countries. Findings further suggest that PPPs in the CGIAR are relatively concentrated in two main areas: (a) accessing resources, information, and technology from the private sector to further center research and (b) commercializing technologies that are designed to improve crop productivity and post-harvest value addition. The report further highlights that the back-and-forth exchanges of knowledge and technology between the partners have accelerated the pace of research and made outcomes possible that the center could not have achieved in isolation. Focusing and prioritizing certain crops for research as CGIAR does as cultivar improvements have direct, beneficial impacts on the incomes and nutrition of small-scale producers or food-insecure consumers; thus, they are critical to achieving sustainable food security and reducing poverty. ",
      "Key Findings": "Drawing on a survey of 75 PPP projects in the international system, ﬁndings suggest that while PPPs are changing the way the system manages its research agenda, few partnerships lead to joint innovation processes with the private sector. This indicates the need for closer examination of organizational practices, cultures, and incentives in the international agricultural research system.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Speciﬁc recommendations include the need for the following:\n1) platforms on which to assemble relevant partners, identify incentive compatibility, agree on mutual objectives, and assign roles and responsibilities appropriately\n(2) resources commitments from all partners not only to a project’s research activities, but also to the coordination activities needed to manage and sustain partners’ commitment\n(3) organizational mechanisms to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and resolve conﬂicts arising from the process, \n(4) benchmarks and decision-points that allow partners to evaluate progress, revise the course of a project, and terminate the project as necessary\n(5) strategies to manage and mitigate the risks associated with projects, including both formal legal and ﬁnancial strategies and informal strategies that emphasize external communications and political support.\n",

      "Document Title": "Public-Private Partnerships in Slovenia: Recent Developments and Perspectives",
      "Document Summary": "In this article, the authors define and analyze the legal framework for public-private partnerships (PPP) as a new institution under Slovenian law. In the first part of the article, the authors define the EU’s concept of PPP which according to the authors, differs from one member state to another. A related issue is the question of the definition of ‘public service.’ Before defining and discussing new forms of PPP as determined in the 2006 Slovenian Law on PPP, the authors discuss the economic rationale for implementing the two types of PPP in Slovenia: special contractually based partnerships and corporate-based partnerships. The former can be a concession agreement or public-procurement agreement, while the latter is a type of newly established or newly transformed legal entity. In the next part of the article, the authors describe new legal procedures governing PPP arrangements in the future and offer some limited empirical evidence on those concession agreements that already exist in Slovenia.",
      "Key Findings": "Following the article, the Slovenian concession law falls into the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) category of ‘adequate’, along with Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Macedonia, which indicates that the concession law is fairly effective and extensive with room for improvement. Slovenian concession law has not changed since being enacted in 1993; however, new PPP legislation, as described in this article, could improve Slovenian marks in the future since Slovenia has modeled its PPP legislation on the basis of, in addition to the suggestions of the EU, the 2000 United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) legislative guide on privately financed infrastructure projects that bind entities in the field of commercial, public services, as well as performers of non-commercial public services. As it is highlighted, no accounting rules have yet been mandated for Slovenian PPPs—especially for public sector participants. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "To conclude, the new Slovenian rules and regulations can certainly be saluted ex-ante since they help to introduce an entrepreneurial spirit into the public sector. It will nevertheless be necessary, from the point of view of legal certainty, to adopt appropriate executive regulations and more specific legislation that will further clarify uncertainties that have arisen in implementing the existing legislation.",

      "Document Summary": "This article examines PPP policies and projects in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (HKSAR) over recent years. The report highlights that before adopting a PPP approach, it might seem prudent to allow opportunities for extensive public debate as to the rationale for the project, the nature of the relative costs and benefits, and the identification of those on whom these might fall. The report emphasizes that failure to adequately involve and consult with all potential stakeholders can easily lead not only to conflicts of interest and failures to recognize and secure the wider public interest but also to project failure. The lack of timely and effective engagement can be contentious and seriously damaging has been demonstrated by several recent potential PPP cases within the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (HKSAR). ",
      "Key Findings": "Ranked by several key agencies as having the freest economy in the world, Hong Kong might appear to be a particularly promising location for using PPPs to attain economic and social infrastructure development goals. Surprisingly, however, many potential PPP projects there frequently fail to reach fruition. Asking why this should be so, the article argues that the lack of certain critical ingredients of ‘good governance’ in Hong Kong has had a direct and negative impact on the fulfillment of its PPP potential. Of particular concern is government’s frequent disregard of public views and the exclusion of the public from early and meaningful participation. This reflects an approach that can perhaps best be described as reliance on ‘Government-Private’ rather than on ‘Public-Private’ Partnerships.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In addition to facilitating appropriate and timely stakeholder and public participation, and while recognising that good governance is never going to be an easy concept either to define or to implement, the UNECE suggests five other principles to follow. These are, essentially: 1) Decency in forming and implementing rules without harming or causing grievance to people; 2) Transparency in making decisions; 3) Accountability with political actors responsible to society for what they say and do; 4)Fairness in applying rules equally to everyone in society; and 5) Efficiency in applying limited human and financial resources without waste, delay or corruption or without prejudicing future generations.

The paper examines how IOs and states enhance their performance by reaching out to private actors and institutions, collaborating with them, and supporting and shaping their activities. ",
      "Key Findings": "A better way to understand and improve IO performance is to consider the full range of ways in which IOs can and do operate—including, increasingly, by reaching out to private actors and institutions, collaborating with them, and supporting and shaping their activities. Such actions are helping to develop an intricate global network of public, private, and mixed institutions and norms, partially orchestrated by IOs, that we call “Transnational New Governance” (TNG). With proper orchestration by IOs, TNG can ameliorate both “state failure”—the inadequacies of IOG—and “market failure”—the problems that result when the creation and evolution of norm-setting institutions is highly decentralized. Orchestration thus provides a significant way for IOs to improve their regulatory performance. Some IOs already engage actively with private actors and institutions—we provide a range of illustrations, highlighting the activities of the UN Environment Program (UNEP). Yet there remains a significant “orchestration deficit” that provides real opportunities for IOs. We draw on the lessons of existing IO activities to suggest additional possibilities for improving IO performance.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This paper recommends IOs work with private partners to expand their available capacities and resources to help IOs to diversify their reliance on states suggesting that such interactions can stimulate IOs to learn and adapt, offsetting some of their bureaucratic pathologies. To take advantage of these opportunities, IOs are suggested to become more proactive in facilitative and directive orchestration. Given the circumstances, IO orchestration offers promising addition to the repertoire of IOs that may improve their performance over a large and growing area of international regulation.",

The consequence of the above is a de facto monopoly for GE-products among a few financially potent companies and for industrial crops.\n2. There is goodwill in, and from those individuals with experience of, the private sector to support development of public good products with expertise and intellectual property, as long as this does not interfere with\ncommercial interests.\n\nThe role of public–private partnerships:\n1. Public–private partnerships function only, if there is a strong mutual interest also for the private partner and if the public partner can be considered reliable.\n2. Public–private partnerships require clear definition of, and\nthe related contractual basis for, those mutual interests and reliable management structures on the public side, to minimise liability risks for the private sector and to ensure that the public sector gets what it needs consistently from the private sector, despite changing personnel and business situations.",

Concrete ideas included: i) adding a consumer perspective into current initiatives to update policy frameworks and regulations; ii) understanding community needs to ensure private providers are responsive to their needs; iii) learning why consumers often prefer the private sector.\n Scalability and sustainability: Many of the PPPs presented during the workshop are small in size and/or do not have large-scale reach (geographic coverage and/or number of people). There was\nmuch discussion and agreement on the need to not only document the growing number of PPPs in HIV/AIDS, but to also explore strategies to take them to scale. Tanzania – through its systematic contracting of FBOs and now commercial providers, and Ghana – through its national health\ninsurance scheme - offer promising approaches on how to take PPPs to scale.",

      "Document Title": "New Technologies in Cash Transfer Programming and Humanitarian Assistance",
      "Key Findings": "This report makes the case for wider adoption of new technology in humanitarian cash and voucher programming. Based on the ever-growing range of experiences of implementing organisations, this report has\nshown how new technologies are tools with potential to serve humanitarian cash-based responses throughout the programme cycle in order to detect needs earlier, enlarge capacity of and speed up response, enhance\nspecificity of transfers to match needs and foster accountability while reducing opportunities for corruption and diversion. It is also becoming recognised that the traditional, manual logistical system of aid provision is\nnot always efficient or effective at addressing the real needs of households and communities affected by crisis, particularly as crises are increasing in frequency and severity in a number of low-income countries. There is an opportunity for provision of technology to realise benefits for recipients that go beyond the duration of the cash transfer programme. In order to realise these benefits, supporting actions would need to be factored into programme timelines and budgets that are likely to go beyond the horizon of emergency response, but in areas subject to regular crises such actions could go some way to increasing their resilience to future shocks.\nTechnology is a tool like any other and its use should add value to humanitarian operations. It is not likely to, nor should it, replace all ‘traditional’ ways of programming, rather it should complement programme processes. However, there remain barriers to implementing technology in humanitarian assistance that must be addressed. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Barriers to technology implementation are caused by entrenched attitudes, mindsets and ways of working, allegiances to existing, possibly outmoded systems and a culture of hierarchy and control within the humanitarian sector which is difficult to move away from. Key recommendations to overcome barriers include: \n\n1. Action for where the rails exist: In areas of high penetration of mobile connectivity, and advancement in e-payment systems, there should be a major push, by donors and agencies, for developing standard approaches to support systematic adoption of new technology in programmes to improve efficiency and effectiveness of aid provision. A starting point would be for members of a cash consortium, or implementing partners of a donor funding cash transfers to determine that they will utilise the same tool to realise economies of scale.\n\n2. Action in contexts of chronic or regular, recurrent crisis: In countries facing protracted crises or cyclical emergencies, where it is possible to say with a high degree of certainty that a future humanitarian programme is required, there should be a push, before the next crisis, for development of new financing models to meet costs of investment and for preparedness frameworks, between donors, agencies and the solutions providers.\n\n3. Action in sudden onset disasters with poor penetration of technology: The period after an emergency has hit is not the time to be attempting to develop technological solutions or new ways of working for the first time. In such cases it is likely agencies should resort to more traditional methods of aid distribution. However, such contexts will become an increasingly small and marginal part of humanitarian response, and the humanitarian community operating in these contexts should stay abreast of developments and seek to move the development of such solutions and of network connectivity forward where possible.",

      "Document Title": "Bridging the Gap: Policy Instruments to Encourage Private Sector Provision of Affordable Rental Housing in Alberta",
      "Document Summary": "This research paper explores alternatives for private sector engagement in the provision of affordable housing and focuses on four clusters of policy instruments: regulatory/planning, fiscal, financial, and institutional. The article provides a much-needed overview of challenges and opportunities in Alberta using the conceptually appropriate analytical framework, fresh empirical evidence, case study analysis, and insights from the practical experiences of industry professionals. Some of the challenges consist of regulatory challenges related to the planning process and community opposition; fiscal barriers associated with senior government fiscal policy; and financial barriers, specifically obstacles related to access to loans for housing development. To address the regulatory challenge, developers, both for-profit and non-profit would like to see an expedited process for affordable housing applications, or at least a predictable streamlined process that reduces the amount of negotiation and compromise between city departments and developers. Engaging the community from the very start of the design process can offset any objections later due to the nature of affordable housing projects and the stigma of unsuccessful past projects. The report suggests developing clarity on the direction of what type of housing is needed and what income groups are intended to be the beneficiaries among the senior government officials is necessary to address fiscal barriers.",
      "Key Findings": "It argues that a much more robust and sustainable system of direct subsidies is required to bridge the funding gap between the cost of development and potential revenue generation in affordable rental housing. In addition to fiscal support from senior governments and improved access to more affordable long-term finance, it suggests that municipalities can play a significant role in facilitating private sector involvement by creating a positive planning and policy environment. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The following five recommendations constitute the most effective methods to encourage private sector participation in the provision of affordable housing. These recommendations could be implemented individually, but would be most effective if considered collectively as they are intended to complement each other to leverage the greatest level of private sector involvement.\n1. Increasing the transparency and predictability of the development\napprovals process.\n2. Providing better access to land at lower costs.\n3. Introducing inclusionary zoning.\n4. Establishing sustainable funding for affordable housing.\n5. Enhancing the role of philanthropy.",

      "Document Summary": "The paper examines water use efficiency and economic efficiency with a particular focus on the Murray –Darling Basin of Australia and the stated policy goal of increasing environmental flows of water in the Basin. The different measures of efficiency are explained, and their implications for water reform and the efficacy of market-based approaches to addressing water scarcity issues and environmental flow needs are explored. The paper points out that public policies to subsidize investments for improvements in irrigation efficiency are shown not to be currently cost-effective compared to alternatives, such as buying water through water markets. The implications of these findings, and the factors that determine the demand for irrigation water by competing uses, can guide policymakers in undertaking water reforms in the agricultural sector to mitigate the environmental consequences of overuse of water resources. To increase the amount of water available, the Australian government is undertaking a series of water reforms that include subsidies to farmers to increase irrigation efficiency and using some of the water savings for the environment, and buying back surface water entitlements to increase environmental flows.",
      "Key Findings": "The report highlights that fundamental to effective water reforms is an understanding of the difference between irrigation and water-use efficiency, basin efficiency, and economic efficiency. Increasing irrigation efficiency may, in some circumstances, reduce water for the environment and downstream users. Farmers who are economically efficient may not necessarily have the highest levels of irrigation efficiency. Further, a given water use that might be economically efficient for an individual farmer may not be economically efficient at a catchment or basin level after accounting for the external cost imposed on others from its use. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The report suggests considering the factors that determine the demand for irrigation water, which is extremely important in the water reform process including the value of irrigation the way irrigators manage risk and uncertainty, spatial and temporal factors, and the nature and impact of water markets across spatial and human scales. Supply-side factors such as poor governance and institutional issues are often ignored as a cause of inefficient water use. By providing a clear understanding of these factors and differences in the various types of efficiency terms, a framework is provided for evaluating water reforms. This framework offers insights into how to overcome some of the key challenges of water scarcity and climate variability in arid and semi-arid environments.",

      "Document Summary": "Public–Private Partnership is a relatively new approach to housing provision and was introduced in Nigeria to address the burgeoning housing challenges. To date, little is known about the contribution of this approach to improving the chances of low-income earners in gaining access to decent and affordable housing in urban areas in this country. Against this background, this study seeks to clarify the contribution of the PPP approach to improving the access of low-income people in urban areas to decent housing. Specifically, this study examines the structure of PPP and the key factors that determine the success (or the lack thereof) of the PPP approach in housing low-income earners in southern Nigeria. Based on the findings the paper makes policy recommendations on how PPP can be improved for better results in Nigeria.",
      "Key Findings": "Based on data obtained from a survey of selected government housing agencies in six cities in southern Nigeria, this study found that the Public–Private-Partnership approach, like most previous public housing delivery strategies, has not made any significant contribution to housing low-income earners; rather it is skewed towards providing housing for high- and middle-income earners. This paper identifies the state-market structure of the Public–Private Partnerships and the absence of a National Policy on Public–Private Partnership in housing in Nigeria as being responsible for this development.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It suggests that the development and adoption of a uniform National Policy on Public–Private Partnership in housing, government provision of land at no cost to private developers, lowering of the high building standards, and incorporation of assisted-self-help and incremental housing into the Public–Private-Partnership housing delivery system will ensure better results.",

      "Document Title": "Determinants of PPP in Infrastructure in Developing Economies",
      "Document Summary": "Using the data on Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) provided by the World Bank, this study attempts to analyze the factors that determine PPP arrangement in infrastructure for the sample period 1990-2008. The analysis focuses specifically on a set of developing countries across the regions. This is mainly because the issue is extremely relevant from the policy perspective in these countries, and it is unwarrantedly neglected in the standard literature. The analysis in this study has provided insight stemming from this different variety of the literature and tested whether factors like governments’ budget constraints, macroeconomic conditions, size of the market, the potential of the currency crisis, regulation, governance, and political environment are crucial in determining PPPs. Considering the data-related potential problems in the analysis, the report has utilized a range of estimators to check the consistency and robustness of the estimations.",
      "Key Findings": "The results of the analysis suggest that large size and relatively higher income markets attract more PPP projects. The empirical evidence also suggests that macroeconomic stability, quality of regulation and governance are important factors in determining PPP in the infrastructure. Surprisingly, however, the evidence fails to provide any strong support for the role of political factors and budget constraint in the process.",
      "Key Recommendations": "From a policy perspective the implications of our results are straightforward. As in most of developing countries, the gap in demand and supply of infrastructure is wide, the public sector is more or less inefficient and governments have budget constraint. In addition, there is a high possibility of private investment crowding out if public expenditure is increased on infrastructure projects. In light of this scenario, PPP arrangement could be a viable and reasonable choice for the policy makers in developing countries. However, the task is not so easy; as our results suggest that it requires a stable macroeconomic condition, which means that governments in the developing countries have to provide stability in the macroeconomic arena by controlling the excess volatility and ensuring enough safety mechanism in the place. Furthermore, to increase the portfolio of PPP projects, developing countries must be prepared to improve overall macroeconomic management, absorb additional explicit and implicit fiscal risks through pursuing strict discipline in fiscal policy. In this context, controlling and managing subsidies on the basis of the political consideration could be a crucial factor. These subsidies often lead to fiscal leakage, inflation, crowing out of private investment as well as fiscal deficit in the developing countries.",

      "Document Summary": "This paper addresses the lack of systematic data about how U.S.-based companies support global education by asking one central question: Do U.S.-based companies leverage their key philanthropic assets to address global education challenges in a way that maximizes shared value for society and business? To answer this question, this study surveyed more than 500 companies; conducted in-depth interviews with corporate philanthropy leaders; and analyzed the existing literature and reports on corporate social responsibility to assess the magnitude, focus, and motivations of U.S. corporate philanthropy vis-à-vis education in developing countries. ",
      "Key Findings": "Findings from the study suggest that U.S.-based companies give approximately half a billion dollars to education in developing countries annually, more than initially projected based on philanthropy estimates. The majority of contributions are in the form of cash and companies make larger cash contributions to global education than their foundations. The report highlights that companies identify many reasons that are strategic to business needs, focusing primarily on community relations, social demand for responsible behavior, and brand identification. But the rationale is a narrow view and does not encompass a full vision of how education-based philanthropy in developing countries can create shared value for business and society. The report highlights that companies rely on nonprofits to implement philanthropy in the education sector over government partners or larger-scale aid agencies. Finally, the paper highlights the assets and liabilities of corporate philanthropy for global education.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The study identifies ten opportunities to achieve greater impact through corporate philanthropy to education in developing countries:\nOpportunity 1: Maximize the Effectiveness of Multiple Donors in the Same Country\nOpportunity 2: Broaden Areas of Strategic Investment\nOpportunity 3: Innovate in Education\nOpportunity 4: Invest in Education in Disaster Contexts for Longer-Term, Higher Impact\nOpportunity 5: Incorporate Local Feedback into Philanthropy Strategies\nOpportunity 6: Build Networks for Global Education\nOpportunity 7: Design Metrics and Invest in Impact Evaluation\nOpportunity 8: Improve NGO Engagement with Corporate Philanthropy\nOpportunity 9: Adopt Innovative Financing by Combining Brand, Business, and Individual Donors\nOpportunity 10: Become Corporate Advocates for Education",

",
      "Key Findings": "Public-private partnerships governing global health are making progress in relation to the prevention and treatment of diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. This progress should not be underestimated as these partnerships are making strides above and beyond efforts of either the public or private sector alone. As a consequence, partnerships are increasingly exercising public power over global health in addition to, or instead of states and International organisations and are thus also becoming capable of adversely impacting the rights of individuals, in particular the right to life and the right to health. Responsibility under international law therefore arises as an issue but, at the moment, partnerships are not directly addressed by the rules of responsibility under international law. This Article describes global health public private partnerships and discusses how public power over global health is increasingly being exercised by these partnerships thereby necessitating a further discussion on responsibility under international law.

      "Document Summary": "This document examines how the G-20 can move towards achieving the Millennium Development goals, by rephrasing how development works. In order to rephrase development, the document examines three case studies to discuss how organizations use the private sector for resources and strategy. The first case study looks at the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange, which addresses how infrastructure can help Ethiopian farmers sell their produce. The second case study addresses Rainforest Alliance Coffee in South America, which is a group of NGOs who are looking to increase the production of coffee that can be grown in the shade. This would lead to less deforestation. The third case study examines the Aceh Partnerships for economic development, which looks at how the UNDP is helping Aceh farmers rehabilitate after the earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia in 2004. In order to rephrase how development works, the document then looks at what the G-20 can do despite not being a development agency and looks at the potential partnership between the UNDP and the G-20.",
      "Key Findings": "The focus of international development efforts has been shifting over the years with new approaches being tried periodically. The problem of poverty and economic inequality continue to plague the world today. While private sector development as an approach has been practiced for several years, it is not employed to its fullest scale due to the belief held by many that helping the poor is strictly a matter of charity. However, in\norder for initiatives to be sustainable in the long-term, they need to benefit both the donors and the recipients. As we have seen through UNDP’s experience, its attempts at fostering entrepreneurship and private sector development have been successful in impacting poverty. The G-20 is an economic powerhouse. By taking on the task of development and specifically by doing so in an inclusive, pro-business manner, it has taken a step in the right direction. It has the power to call for changes in business practices, and to target its funding towards enterprise creation initiatives. Backed by the financial resources and political will that the organization has, it can make a real difference to poverty in much of the world.",
      "Key Recommendations": "When considering the criticism made of past private sector engagement in development, one of the main points is the importance of building a domestic private sector. While it is important to foster relationships with large multinational corporations, these relationships must be built in a way that encourages development of small and medium sized enterprises in the recipient country, and does not restrict them to be simply suppliers of raw materials for these MNCs. The G-20 can also play a part in supporting sustainable business practices in multinational corporations.\nOne of the main cross-cutting issues that surfaces repeatedly is the need for regulation to check the activities of the private sector and a sound business environment to allow it flourish. This could be accomplished by a body established under G-20 which does research on doing business, provides guidelines to countries for establishing regulations in their national laws, disseminates successful case studies and provides the\nframework for countries to form successful partnerships with the private sector. Another role the G-20 can play is in advocating for better policies with national governments of developing nations.",

      "Document Title": "Adversaries versus Partners: Urban Water Supply in the Philippines",
      "Document Summary": "In this paper, the author contends that the legal framework created between the government and the concessionaires was designed to address concerns about information asymmetries and guard against public backlash about private sector involvement in urban water provision in Manila by providing monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, creating a regulatory office and clarifying requirements through a contract. The author of this paper further argues that this legal framework established adversarial interactions between private corporations and regulators, with the perverse result of preventing the collaborative negotiations needed to adjust contractual responsibilities effectively and equitably as external conditions changed. \n\nWhile this analysis has focused on water provision, the experiences in Manila provide more general insight into the development of public-private partnerships for public goods and urban infrastructure, particularly the ways in which the initial context, contractual arrangements, and organizational dynamics affect partnership outcomes. Most centrally, these cases reveal how political pressures can influence the structure of governing arrangements and relationships among stakeholders and how these directly affect the ways in which organizations can respond to crises. Legal constraints and tense interactions in Manila prevented effective engagement among state and non-state actors in responding to external shocks.",
      "Key Findings": "In the Philippines, skepticism about private sector participation in urban water provision became increasingly pronounced as missed service targets and regulatory battles plagued governmental relations with the two companies (Manila Water and Maynilad) granted concessions for water provision in the capital, Manila. A comparative study of these two public-private partnerships (PPPs) reveals the challenges of reconciling bureaucratic and organizational dynamics with public suspicion of the private sector. This study draws on interviews and observations with corporate and government officials, academics, journalists, non-governmental organizations and civil society members in the Philippines, almost a decade after the initial privatization. This paper furthers our understanding of the outcomes in Manila—and PPPs more generally—by addressing the tension between credible commitment in contractual arrangements and flexibility for responding to economic and environmental shocks. It argues that adversarial interactions between the private corporations and regulators hindered the collaborative negotiations needed to respond to the currency crisis.",
      "Key Recommendations": "While goodwill and friendly discussions might not have been enough to overcome an economic crisis and ideological divides, the lack of willingness to negotiate in good faith in conjunction with a bargaining process focused on profit maximization, and blame avoidance failed to produce outcomes that benefitted the public. This reveals the imperative of reconciling flexibility with transparency and accountability. The paper suggests that with greater community engagement from across socio-economic groups, issues beyond prices and company survival including, notably, pro-poor policies and water provision might have been addressed. This analysis suggests that dynamic and uncertain futures for urban infrastructure and service provision are best addressed not through more rigid and explicit contracts and monitoring but through the development of more collaborative, inclusive, and robust partnerships that allow for negotiable contracts. Focusing on fostering the conditions for mutual gains and open dialogue, rather than blame allocation and adversarial negotiations might lead to more equitable, cost-effective, and consequently successful private-sector participation in public goods provision.",

      "Key Findings": "Encouraging constructive youth participation across different segments of society is a necessary step towards ensuring the growth and sustainability of a country's business operations and general macroeconomic environment. Countries that emphasize the education, job training, and health of their populations are almost always better positioned to compete in the global economy than those that do not. Therefore, it is safe to suggest that more effective youth-targeted social expenditure will, in the mid- to long-term, increase a population's productive capacity and overall economic welfare. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "There is ample evidence to indicate that when young people are more engaged economically, particularly in the private sector, the benefits resonate throughout society. As such, it is incumbent upon today’s private sector actors not only to harness the underutilized potential of youth, but also to spur the type of sustainable human capital development that will ensure a prosperous future for all.\n\nFirms should conceive of young people not only as appropriate corporate social responsibility targets, but also as co-stakeholders in the process of global development. Because today's youth display unparalleled levels of creativity, energy and entrepreneurial spirit, the private sector would benefit from greater engagement with this large population group. ",

      "Document Title": "Public-Private Integrated Partnerships Demonstrate The Potential To Improve Health Care Access, Quality, And Efficiency",
      "Document Summary": "This article describes the integrated partnership model in greater detail, highlighting both its potential benefits and risks. It describes how the model differs from other public-private partnership arrangements, provides examples of integrated partnerships in various countries, and examines lessons from both failed and successful arrangements. An integrated partnership consists of the government and a private partner—usually a consortium of health providers and financiers. Facilities developed through this model are intended to serve the same population as the public facilities they replace, including providing access for the poor. The potential benefits of well-structured integrated partnerships are that they can provide greater stability in capital and operational public budgets, improve equity of access, and improve quality. The report further suggests that integrated partnership, in operation for a decade, has generated considerable outcome data showing that it provides high-quality services at 25 percent lower cost than public facilities. ",
      "Key Findings": "The authors cited several factors contributing to the partnerships’ difficulties. First, the parties were unable to agree on methods for negotiating annual operating budgets. Second, the lack of data and transparency of public-sector costs made it difficult to establish “fair value” in pricing for contracted services and accounting for changes in volume over time. Third, contracts with few demand-side controls resulted in too much risk being transferred to private operators, which made the contracts unsustainable.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This article has provided critical guidance to manage such difficulties as well. First, the integrated partnership requires strong and sustained leadership from senior champions in the government with sufficient political stature to manage powerful stakeholders. Second, integrated partnerships should position the government ministries, particularly the ministry of health as regulators, partnership managers, and purchasers. To be successful in these roles requires dedicated resources and sufficient investment in capacity building. Third, the success of the arrangement is determined by the ability of the public and private sectors to forge a partnership that can adapt to the inevitable changes that will occur over a multi-year relationship. Fourth, the selection of the right private partner requires greater interaction and discussion with potential bidders during the precontracting phases, and a more flexible approach to procurement than traditional public processes often allow. In conclusion, these arrangements may require new institutions—in the government or independent bodies—that can develop and monitor performance standards to demonstrate continued value for investment and achievement of policy objectives.

      "Document Summary": "This document examines how public health services face challenges, due to a lack of resources. Governments around the world are now looking towards public-private partnerships to improve access, quality, and efficiency in the health care sector. The document describes how integrated partnerships can help enlist private capital to help provide health care access and gives three examples of these partnerships-Lesotho, Spain, and Turks and Caicos- to showcase how integrated partnerships work. These examples demonstrate how integrated partnerships are efficient and are cost effective. The article concludes the international community should support integrated partnerships and study these partnerships more, so they can refine the health care system. \n",
      "Key Findings": "We describe the benefits and risks inherent in such integrated partnerships and present three case studies that demonstrate innovative design. We conclude that these partnerships have the potential to improve access, quality, and efficiency in health care. More such partnerships should be widely shared to guide policy makers in the effective use of this model. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "We encourage the international community to strengthen the evidence base by supporting integrated partnerships and evaluating their performance, to provide practical guidance to policy makers on when and how to use this model most effectivly. ",

      "Document Summary": "While there are tens of millions of children out of school, hundreds of millions more are in school but receiving an education of such poor quality that they have little prospect of gaining the literacy, numeracy, and life skills needed to be productive members of society. This crisis has economic and social benefits that are devastatingly high, stifling economic growth, perpetuating poverty, and creating unstable societies. This article provides insights into how this crisis is impacting the global business community. It argues that corporate resources are deployed in such an inefficient manner to support global education that these practices would never pass muster in a company's day-to-day business. \n\nThe article further suggests that if the global communities work together, they can strengthen the business community’s engagement in education and allow it to serve as a force for results-oriented change in education, bringing a win-win situation for the poor and non-poor countries. ",
      "Key Findings": "Justin van Fleet argues that corporations must come together under the united banner of a Global Business Coalition for Education to address the global learning crisis in the developing countries. Van Fleet says that creating a united coalition would strengthen the business community's engagement in education and force result-oriented changes.",

      "Document Title": "Health Research Systems: Promoting Health Equity or Economic Competitiveness? ",
      "Document Summary": "The 2008 Global Forum for Health Research report's figures indicate that international research funding makes up a small percentage (1.6%) of the 160.3 billion United States dollars (US$) of total global health research expenditure. This paper argues that current policies restrict the capacity of international collaborative health research to promote global health equity by diverting funding away from research that is needed to implement existing interventions and strengthen health systems, i.e., health policy and systems research. \n\nThe report further argues that laws and policies in high-income countries ensure that most international research funding is not directed to much-needed health policy and systems research making a limited contribution to improving global health equity. To redress the investment imbalance, its structural causes must be clearly identified. Achieving sustained growth in health policy and systems research in developing countries, this report suggests significant reform to existing research laws and policies in high-income countries. ",
      "Key Findings": "International collaborative health research is justifiably expected to help reduce global health inequities. Investment in health policy and systems research in developing countries is essential to this process but, currently, funding for international research is mainly channeled towards the development of new medical interventions. This imbalance is largely due to research legislation and policies used in high-income countries. These policies have increasingly led these countries to invest in health research aimed at boosting national economic competitiveness rather than reducing health inequities. In the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the regulation of research has encouraged a model that: leads to products that can be commercialized; targets health needs that can be met by profitable, high-technology products; has the licensing of new products as its endpoint; and does not entail significant research capacity strengthening in other countries. Accordingly, investment in international research is directed towards pharmaceutical trials and product development public–private partnerships for neglected diseases. This diverts funding away from research that is needed to implement existing interventions and to strengthen health systems, i.e. health policy and systems research. Governments must restructure their research laws and policies to increase this essential research in developing countries.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To begin, high income country governments should design and enact policies that: (i) create strong incentives for health policy and systems research; (ii) support higher education and university departments in such research; and (iii) foster health policy and systems research partnerships between public research bodies, academia, health providers and private foundations. To encourage this kind of research, governments could, for example, create a fund source by applying a tax to the profits from products derived from trial data collected in developing countries. Governments could then distribute the funds in response to open competitive tenders. Research tax credits could be extended to health providers and research institutions that conduct health policy and systems research.",

      "Document Summary": "This paper addresses the idea of a “sustainable megacity” that can support growth needs and presents how we could measure the degree of sustainability of a megacity. This paper addresses possible efforts to address the process of a sustainable megacity and how it could be possible with the help of global capital. ",
      "Key Findings": "The model of economic development, in general faces the dilemma of resource scarceness and the manageability of required output from limitation of resources would be challenging task for policymakers. Therefore, development of megacity which could franchise the demands of economic development is an important element. Hence, we reached on this conclusion that, sustainable megacity is the essential ingredient of economic development. This paper addresses the role of local government in coordination with provincial and federal government for the development of sustainable megacities by utilizing the assistance of global-capital. We tried to address degree specific 132 indicators to construct the benchmark for megacity which could describe the sustainability level of megacity that how and by which process the same transaction is possible or implementable.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The report highlights that the role of local government in developing a sustainable megacity is vital because it could transfer the roots of action to the grassroots. However, the same transaction could only be possible by implementing legal and administrative reforms; it would systematically demand decentralization and participation of the ordinary individual. Finally, policymakers may need to arrange the funds for development using ethical leadership and professional entrepreneurship because the sustainability of a megacity is an essential factor; else, it would be a burden and center of problems for the economy and society.",

      "Document Summary": "There is growing excitement among governments, international organizations, the private sector, philanthropic organizations, and civil society about the potential of technology and innovation to dramatically improve the lives of poor people around the world. This report consolidates seven policy briefs to explore these issues in detail, lay out the challenges, and offer a range of specific recommendations on what needs to happen and why. ",
      "Key Findings": "“The Innovation Revolution and its Implications for Development,” written by Laurence Chandy and Homi Kharjas, explores how technology-driven innovations in finance, management, and accountability can catalyze scaled-up development interventions that reach poor people around the world, but that this depends on the forging of partnerships between nonprofit and for-profit actors. “New Frontiers: Launching Digital Financial Services in Rural Areas,” authored by Cameron Peake, surveys the landscape of digital financial services in rural Africa, Asia, and Latin America and provides valuable lessons gleaned from Mercy Corp’s experience in implementing programs on the ground and reaching populations at the very bottom of the pyramid. In “Harnessing Connection Technologies for Development,” Anne-Marie Slaughter and Eleanor Meegoda put forward a framework to describe the different types of mass networks that have emerged from advances in communication (or connection) technologies and are being harnessed to address global development challenges and pose pertinent questions to guide further research in this exciting new field.\n\nIn \"Innovation and Technology for Green Growth,\" Nathan Hultman, Katherine Sierra, and Allison Shapiro categorize the various green growth innovations and examine recent R&D and investment trends before reviewing new approaches that help countries simultaneously realize economic, environmental, and development goals. The importance of Business Models: Mike Kubzansky argues that designing effective business models matter far more than the technology behind a product when targeting the very poor and explains why it is difficult for the private sector to develop viable business models for this segment of the global population and offers suggestions on how governments, donors, and businesses can work together to overcome obstacles. In \"It’s What You Make, Not How You Make It—Why Africa Needs a Strategy for Structural Change,\" John Page asserts that structural change—the shift of resources in a country with low to high productivity sectors—is more important than technology in addressing the current jobs crisis in Africa and recommends specific steps to kick-start transformation and create globally competitive industries on the continent. Lastly, in \"Delivering U.S. Leadership: Roles for the Public Sector,\" Molly Kinder examines the role of the public sector in unlocking innovation to deliver development “better, cheaper and faster and at scale” and offers recommendations for how the U.S. government and other donor countries can work with the private sector and philanthropic organizations to drive a global innovation agenda.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Overcoming the weaknesses subsidized and for-profit models requires partnerships between nonprofit and profit actors through the creation of hybrid models. Hybrid models would combine the development efforts of a government, donor, foundation and/or INGO with that of a private corporation under a joint venture, which builds on the financial and accountability strengths of the nonprofit sector and the management, implementation and innovation strengths of the private sector. \n2. Financial products should integrate strategies to overcome barriers related to illiteracy. There are typically higher levels of illiteracy in rural areas and financial literacy may be low, both of which can inhibit effective adoption of services. \n3. For bank-led models, it may be wise to team with an MNO for rural development or look at more human-centered solutions where transaction data may not be real time, but regularly synched as the network allows. \n4.  Central to the green growth strategy is technological innovation\nand the establishment of creative, integrated, private and public sector approaches to support innovation in developing countries.\n5. A first, necessary condition for donors to begin to engage meaningfully with private firms, whether smaller impact enterprises or large MNCs, is the creation of independent, arm’s-length intermediaries with the expertise, independence and investment outlook to be able to take on such tasks, and to do so at the scale required to address the problems at hand. \n6. U.S. Leadership: Roles for the Public Sector\n   1) Measure Cost-Effectiveness and Set Clear Targets;\n   2) Set Aside Funding for Evaluation and Learn from Failure;\n   3) Create Multidonor Special Intermediary to Seed and Scale Up \n       Innovative Private Sector Solutions.",

      "Document Title": "The Business Case For Sustainable Finance: Beyond Public Relations, Ethics, and Philanthropy",
      "Document Summary": "This paper highlights the importance of considering environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in the financial world to make the sector sustainable from a commercial point of view. Thus, there is a need for sector-specific, topic-specific, and region-specific perspectives to build and present a systematic business case for sustainable finance. The article defines ESG as public interest issues affecting human, societal, and environmental well-being and increasingly relevant to business and finance operations. ESG factors and sustainability issues are industry, region, and context-specific. Besides the mission that both the private sector and the financial institutions make a profit, they should have a societal responsibility to fulfill. When financial institutions remain uninterested in environmental problems that affect all economic stakeholders, including businesses—the public justifiably equates their indifference with irresponsibility. ",
      "Key Findings": "The paper further argues that money should not drive an entity to do the right thing. However, ethical considerations and appeals to morality might not be sufficient to facilitate change. Individual ethical persuasion may not surmount structural challenges such as institutional, legal, or social dynamics and obligations. While academic and non-profit circles present various arguments as to why finance should investigate the ways to improve the impact and sustainability of the industry, it should be noted that unless an entity realizes and internalizes on a micro-level the business benefits of an approach, outside rhetoric rarely results in genuine and meaningful change. Therefore, the goal here is a discussion of the genuine business arguments for ESG analysis and sustainable finance rather than articulating what the public needs from the finance industry.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In conclusion, ESG issues may initially seem to be of concern to the public only. Yet, various perspectives from financial institutions worldwide point to the materiality of these issues to the financial sector. Changing landscapes are redefining and deconstructing the way that ESG issues are understood to affect business and the economy, and they can no longer be dismissed as secondary concerns. Perhaps the strongest evidence for the business case for sustainable finance, however, is the growing level of interest and practice among large financial institutions.",

      "Document Summary": "This study aims to investigate the criteria adopted for allocating the risks in energy from waste (EfW) PPPs through a comparative analysis of three EfW case studies in Italy and the UK. It develops an analytical framework based on both the management and bearing of risk as the main criteria to allocate risks both between public and private sectors and within each PPP‟s special purpose vehicle (SPV). The comparative analysis, in accordance with the literature, highlights the deficiencies of the criterion universally adopted for allocating risks in PPPs, namely, to allocate risk to the party best able to manage it. The dynamic nature of the business context is in sharp contrast with the static risk management criterion; this paper makes clear that complex and long-term PPP contracts require further work investigating the risk-bearing criteria required for allocating risks efficiently and effectively in a dynamic situation of incomplete contracts.",
      "Key Findings": "All three cases analyzed in this study reveal that:  \n \n•\tConsistent with other findings in the academic literature, the ability to manage risk is the unique criterion adopted in practice both between public and private parties and within the SPV. In fact, SPVs have passed on as many as possible of the risks for which they agreed to become contractually liable.\n•\tAlthough not recognized by that literature, the case studies suggest the bearing of default risks remains with the public partner whatever the contractual arrangements with the private partner.\n•\tAlthough the private partners recognize that the bearing of risk is not coincident with the management of risk, the public sector partners seem oblivious of this fact and so fail to understand the importance of this issue.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "•\tThe case studies make clear that justification of use of PPPs is predominantly based on the avoidance of the delays in construction and commissioning of service infrastructures associated with conventional procurement. This justification is however at best partial by default and at worst deliberately highly selective in its portrayal and treatment of risk. This is not to say there are no risk management benefits to be derived from PPPs but, instead, suggests that the risk management rationale for PPPs has been overstated and the need for robust risk governance mechanisms neglected accordingly.  \n•\tThe case studies make clear also that contractual rigidity is in sharp contrast with the dynamism of context, suggesting that further work on governance aspects is required, especially those that can be important in managing contractual incompleteness over time. \n•\tThe case studies‟ results make clear that these governance issues must be addressed irrespective of the particular form and structure of PPPs in EfW schemes and irrespective of their context and host country. Hence, further work should extend the analytical framework adopted in this study by considering governance aspects to deal with contractual incompleteness and how it should be governed in a dynamic (rather than static) interactive business context. This more holistic approach is required to underpin value for money.\n\n",

      "Document Summary": "The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the needed effort to address the promise, potential, and challenges associated with PPPs, which are illustrated through examples of partnerships in global health, where particular emphasis is placed on strategies for public accountability, risk management, and governance. Such a contribution, in turn, would be expanding our understanding of PPPs in general and bridging the divide between theory and practice in the fields of global health and public administration. In view of this paper, PPPs are emerging as an attractive strategy for leveraging the strengths of multiple sources in order to address health issues in low and middle-income countries. Recognizing that fiscal limitations and uncertainty will likely remain a part of the political landscape, there is an increased demand for tax money to be used efficiently and effectively. In this context, it is not surprising that along with the success stories there are concerns about the use of global PPPs to address health issues in developing countries. These concerns have to do, first of all, with issues of public accountability. When something goes wrong, and former partners point accusatory fingers at one another, it is difficult to establish accountability or to assure that such fiascos will not be repeated. These concerns result from the inherent difficulty in addressing issues such as risk management and the governance of PPPs when the multiple partners are guided by their respective values and priorities that might not be consistent with each other. The study further articulates those public-private partnerships are more compelling than the alternative of doing nothing.",
      "Key Findings": "Collaboration between organizations in different sectors of the economy is not a new development, but it has become increasingly dominant in the discourse on public sector reform (Wettenhall 2003). Partnerships between government and organizations in other sectors of the economy are now accepted as a promising way of generating new opportunities to leverage financial, human, and technological resources that will not be available if government goes it alone (Bovaird 2004, Savas 2000, O’Looney 1992, Linder 1999, Rosenau 2000). In particular, PPPs are emerging as an attractive strategy for leveraging the strengths of multiple sources in order to address health issues in low and middle-income countries. The promise, potential and challenges associated with PPPs are illustrated through examples of partnerships in global health, where particular emphasis is placed on strategies for public accountability, risk management, and governance. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the needed effort to address this gap in the literature on PPPs in global health. Such a contribution, in turn, would be expanding our understanding of PPPs in general and bridging the divide between theory and practice in the fields of global health and public administration.  ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The paper suggests that a more in-depth examination of current PPPs in the area of global health and the mobilization of theoretical frameworks from multiple disciplines to study its various aspects would shed additional light on the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Longitudinal studies of PPPs that have been established to deal with global health issues seem to be an urgent issue. Such case studies would not only advance the understanding of PPPs, in general, but their better use for dealing with health issues. In addition, the role those academic institutions should play in public-private partnerships holds much promise not only in terms of facilitating continued research on this subject but as a strategy for elevating in-house accountability. After all, the high standards of intellectual and scientific integrity that are expected to be upheld by researchers and the consequences of not adhering to them make academicians the likely canaries to flag medical, administrative, and ethical risks in the mines of global health.",

      "Document Summary": "The purpose of this paper is to present one of the most innovative and successful cases of its kind in the world, a social enterprise rural distribution model originally developed by CARE Bangladesh and the Bata Shoe Company, to illustrate the possibility of combining market-based solutions to poverty with socially responsible business growth. The case provides insights into the origins, lessons learned, and key success factors of viable rural sales agent distribution networks serving the poor. A key tension to be managed is keeping the costs of the network down while ensuring that every member is adequately incentivized.  ",
      "Key Findings": "Although a number of similar door-to-door direct sales models exist around the world, the distribution of socially beneficial goods through a direct sales force was one of the most promising market-based social enterprise business models and “one to watch” with the potential to create value for the poor if organizations could get the details right. Lessons from the Rural Sales Program in Bangladesh are vitally important contributions to practical knowledge about this high-potential social enterprise model. In this respect, the experience of the Rural Sales Program offers a number of important lessons. One of the important lessons is that the Rural Sales Program not only offers a wide variety of products but further shares costs and increases revenues through the network by including multiple companies. Having a wider variety of goods on offer through a network shared by multiple companies also ultimately provides rural customers with greater access to socially beneficial goods. The overall costs of the network are also kept down as hub owners, and Aparajitas are engaged as independent entrepreneurs with low fixed and variable overhead costs. Assigning non-overlapping territories of sufficient size and initially building the network with sales of “pull” products that are already in demand also contribute to the financial sustainability of the network. \n\nSocial implications – The 3,000 women sales agents in rural Bangladesh engaged with the Rural Sales Program have benefited from earning viable incomes in contexts where opportunities for employment and empowerment of women are limited. Rural populations have gained affordable access to socially beneficial goods such as fortified foods, seeds, daily necessities and shoes. Companies have benefited from learning how to adapt their product offerings to meet the needs of low-income customers.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The experience of the Rural Sales Program highlights that a critical piece to get right is the configuration of the distribution channel between the sales agents and companies. The Rural Sales Program’s experience suggests that the most important first step in increasing access to socially beneficial goods is to focus on building the financial sustainability of the network first. Once a rural distribution network is established and financially sustainable, it can be leveraged to increase access to types of socially beneficial goods such as feeds, medicines, and other agricultural inputs that may be more expensive to sell and distribute.

      "Document Title": "Foreign Aid in Post-Conflict Countries: The Case of South Sudan",
      "Document Summary": "This paper suggests that foreign aid in a post-conflict situation requires a new approach different from the traditional one of discrete phases along the emergency relief, political reform to development continuum. Instead, aid intervention aimed at accelerating economic recovery and growth ought to be at the forefront of aid as soon as it can be managed securely and is most effective when enacted concurrently with political and democratic change. This can be achieved through economic and institutional reforms that encourage private sector-led growth. Countries that emerged from violent conflict or civil wars are generally characterized by weak policies, institutions, governance, and a higher probability of reverting to conflict. South Sudan fits all these characteristics, but it also has the challenges of building new institutions and rules of governance as an independent nation. It faces the challenges of establishing a basic institutional framework in the context of low human capital stock with a public sector compromised largely of former leaders in the military and other ex-combatants. In light of this, the U.S. Government through USAID began to invest in technical assistance and training back in 2004 prior to the creation of the Comprehensive Peace Accord. ",
      "Key Findings": "Through this intervention, the U.S. Government/USAID developed core institutional structures to strengthen the executive function of the semi-autonomous GOSS, the legal framework, and the financial sector. It established five core institutions: the Bank of South Sudan, a branch of the Central Bank of Sudan, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, the Ministry of Legal Affairs and Constitutional Development, and the Office of the Presidential Affairs with mixed results in achieving the goal. The MDTF managed by the Six Country JDT experienced a similar challenge related to aid absorption capacity. The evaluation found that, in ignorance of the ground reality, they had created the MDTF based on unrealistic assumptions and expectations. The USAID and the JDT experiences were indicative of the difficult choices faced by aid donors in post-conflict situations. Technical assistance would often end up deliberately underutilized by its counterparts, as demonstrated by the USAID Core Institutional Structure Program. Nevertheless, the approach of deploying additional aid for economic and institutional reforms in support of more rapid growth led by the private sector has yielded to date a positive result, but more ought to be expected. The case of South Sudan provides preliminary support and suggestive lessons in support of the new approach for aid intervention in post-conflict economics. ",

      "Document Summary": "This paper highlights the flaws in the narrow vision of business engagement in global education over the past decade. It has also outlined the core principles of a paradigm shift for corporate engagement in education that should be followed to ensure that the business community plays a sustainable and valuable role in addressing the global learning crisis and, particularly, issues of educational equity. \n\nEmerging data exposes dismal learning levels in developing countries. Approximately 200 million children worldwide are enrolled in school but learning so little that they struggle to read. In some countries in sub-Saharan Africa, a child with five years of schooling has a 40 percent chance of being illiterate, which shows the desperate need to expand the collaboration with business communities, government, and donor agencies.",
      "Key Findings": "Private companies’ support of education in developing countries has been largely inefficient and unable to create large-scale change, especially for the world’s most marginalized populations. There are opportunities to leverage the expertise of the education community and the collective action of various stakeholders, including governments, multilateral and bilateral agencies, foundations, and communities, to improve corporate investments in support of global education. In this piece, I highlight the flaws in the narrow vision of business engagement in global education over the past decade.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The report recommends engaging the corporate sector in education on a broad-based approach, rallying all stakeholders in the private sector around core education needs, if it is to address the leading social and economic growth crisis of its time: a lack of equitable access to learning for all. By working collaboratively across a series of stakeholders to enhance government capacity in education provision, the private sector should be able to harness the unique assets each company brings to the table and leverage those of other stakeholders in education. The new set of principles outlined in this paper provides a framework for the business community’s engagement in education. \n\nPrinciple 1: Make a Direct Link between Investing in Learning and Core Business\n\nPrinciple 2: Evaluate Impact using Outcomes-Based Learning Metrics\n\nPrinciple 3: Promote Meaningful Collaboration\n\nPrinciple 4: Support Government Capacity to Provide Quality\nEducation\n\nPrinciple 5: Play an Advocacy Role to Promote the Importance of Education and Learning",

      "Document Title": "Trait stacking for biotech crops: an essential consideration for agbiotech development projects for building trust",
      "Key Findings": "Our social audit engagement with one of these initiatives, the Water Efficient Maize for Africa project, has revealed that a critical but unrecognized component of building trust with farmers involves publicly addressing the concerns surrounding stacked trait crops. As a result, we argue in this article that it is critical to actively anticipate the concerns that could be raised over trait stacking by incorporating them into global access plans of such initiatives early in order to facilitate adoption, provide the best value to the small-scale farmer and gain trust with the community whom these projects aim to serve. This perspective, based on an actual international social audit, should be of value to scientists, funders and partners involved in biotech development initiatives for food security.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The concerns raised over the use of stacked traits as uniquely revealed by our social audit of the WEMA project are applicable to other current and upcoming agbiotech projects. Principal investigators and funders of\nhumanitarian agbiotech initiatives should actively anticipate these concerns and incorporate them into their project plans in order to gain trust with the community they aim to serve. Although issues such as cost-effectiveness and the engagement of multiple project partners may be perceived as constraints to incorporating the use of stacked traits in agbiotech development projects, cases such as the Golden Rice project and AgrisureW 3000GT demonstrate that such obstacles can be overcome, especially if project partners commit to maintaining a hu-\nmanitarian focus. We believe that publicly addressing concerns surrounding stacked traits early in biotech development initiatives will increase the potential of all partners and stakeholders to generate mutually advantageous solutions and enhance opportunities to build trust.",

      "Key Findings": "There is not any particular evidence to support the view that simply abolishing NGOs and private contractors, or cutting off aid, will cause the population to seek a more accountable government. But it is clear that NGOs and private contractors need to be more effective and more accountable. They do need to improve cooperation with each other and with the Government of Haiti, and be held to common principles, in order to achieve better outcomes. Systematic and widely-accessible evaluations by NGOs and contractors,\ncompliance with the International Aid Transparency Initiative, and increased use by the government of competitive bidding—may help to hold international organizations accountable and rebuild government capacity while maintaining the delivery of services to the people of Haiti.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It is likely that NGOs and private contractors will continue to dominate service provision in Haiti for some time to come. In light of this fact, we recommend three options to improve the current situation. \n\nOne: NGOs and private contractors carry out systematic and widely accessible evaluations of their work. \n\nTwo: All actors in Haiti be held accountable by publishing data on expenditures and outcomes in Haiti. The International Aid Transparency Initiative may be the perfect vehicle for this and the Unites States government should require NGOs (and possibly private contractors) to report to IATI. IATI compliance might eventually be a prerequisite for receiving US funds. \n\nAnd three: The Government of Haiti procure services through competitive bidding whenever possible, in order to maintain service delivery while building local capacity over the longer term.",

      "Document Title": "How PEPFAR’s Public-Private Partnerships Achieved Ambitious Goals, From Improving Labs To Strengthening Supply Chains",
      "Document Summary": "This paper presents how the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)’s Public-Private Partnerships achieved ambitious goals from improving labs to strengthening supply chains while also improving the lives of millions of people in the developing world living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. Part of the program’s success is attributable to the participation of the private sector, working in partnership with the US and local governments and implementing organizations to maximize the reach and effectiveness of every dollar spent. The paper has examined key public-private partnerships that grew out of PEPFAR to identify features that have made them effective. The study found that setting ambitious goals, enlisting both global and local partners, cultivating a culture of collaboration, careful planning, continuous monitoring and evaluation, and measuring outcomes systematically led to the most effective programs. The experience of the Office of the US Global AIDS Coordinator and PEPFAR since 2003 has shown that they have been willing to embrace ambitious partnerships and break new ground in how the US government collaborates with the private sector and country partners. That leadership has been central to PEPFAR’s success. ",
      "Key Findings": "We found that setting ambitious goals, enlisting both global and local partners, cultivating a culture of collaboration, careful planning, continuous monitoring and evaluation, and measuring outcomes systematically led to the most effective programs. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "In the coming years, the report suggests that PEPFAR should continue to broaden its capacity for private-sector partnerships, learning from its first decade of experience and identifying new ways to make smart investments that will deliver even more value for money in such areas as integrating the private sector into health service delivery, increasing the supply of trained health workers, expanding workplace programs for HIV prevention and treatment, and integrating strategies that address the health needs of women and children such as reducing gender-based violence, into the entire spectrum of PEPFAR’s activities at the country level.",

      "Document Summary": "This discussion paper aims to identify potential aspects linking the Public-private mix (PPM) approach to health systems building blocks, using a few experiences from tuberculosis control and beyond. The paper targets policymakers, donors, and health systems scientists and ends with a call for more awareness and innovative leadership, for increased support of PPM initiatives covering various building blocks, and for more operational research. ",
      "Key Findings": "As the paper highlights, health systems strengthening (HSS) is being increasingly recognized as a strategic cross-cutting issue in all World Health Organization (WHO) work. Health systems comprise six building blocks: service delivery, medical products, vaccines and technologies, health workforce, health systems financing, health information system, and leadership and governance. Public-private mix (PPM) approaches or partnerships consist of initiatives aimed at increasing collaboration and improving the relationships between public–public, public-private, and private–private health providers. An important component of PPM is the clear distribution of tasks between the different providers involved in the provision of health care. In practice, most PPM initiatives are disease-specific and are often related to the health service delivery block mentioned above. Although there is widespread consensus that PPM initiatives are typical of an HSS nature, efforts to make explicit the links between PPM and health systems building blocks are rather uncommon.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This paper calls for an extended approach to the role of the private sector in health, arguing that private actors are relevant with respect to all health system building blocks beyond the sole health services delivery component and vertical disease control programs. Policymakers’ awareness of this potential and their innovative and leadership capabilities are key to shaping and managing such initiatives. Moreover, donors are needed to promote non-disease-specific PPM initiatives. Operational research to assess the relevance and effectiveness of PPM initiatives with regard to different health system building blocks will be highly useful in informing health policy.",

The article intends to critically assess conflicting and overlapping views on contractual and institutional PPPs, their forms, and models to draw insights into transitional economies. \n\nThe article presents critical elements associated with PPP and necessary for theoretical building, theory testing, and further research. The value of this paper is in providing clarification of a position adopted by some authors and governments regarding a specific PPP aspect rather than just presenting another author’s view. It is up to a researcher to decide what stance she or he wants to take in reference to the meaning of a PPP or a specific PPP issue. ",
      "Key Findings": "After analyzing different approaches to the meaning of a PPP, its forms, models, stakeholders to be involved in the PPP process, and calculating benefits to society, the paper suggests that public-private partnership should not be understood as institutional arrangements bringing merely benefits. Only the long-run view of PPPs may offer an accurate assessment of their benefits, costs, and externalities. In contrast to across-the-broad kind of statements regarding PPP advantages, efficiency, and strengths for a society that can hardly be justified. Each project requires individual evaluation and one can link its merits and positive spillover effects, discounted by costs and negative externalities, to the specific groups of society’s beneficiaries.",

      "Document Summary": "This paper is intended to promote public-private cooperation (PPC) in the Department of Defense (DOD). The paper articulates the imperative for PPC and then proposes an analytical framework that features four broad categories along a continuum of formality: contractual arrangements, well-defined standards and protocols, broad frameworks for interaction, and emergent or undefined situations. This paper anticipates challenges and identifies steps to overcome them. It provides examples from each of the four categories, including how the collaborators overcame the challenges they faced and practical implications for future PPC efforts. ",
      "Key Findings": "Public Private Cooperation (PPC) has proved to be effective at the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Department of Defense leaders are expressing interest in implementing parallel approaches. PPC is intended to further policy objectives, enhance U.S. operational capabilities, reduce costs, gain access to nonmilitary expertise or assets, or build greater capacity in partners. As DOD adapts to meet evolving roles and missions in an unpredictable and complex world amid fiscal constraints, the expertise and involvement of the private sector, including nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), research institutions, and academia will be essential. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on discussions and findings, the paper suggests several broad conclusions about enhancing PPC that can be applied immediately. Clarifying PPC objectives early, promoting PPC benefits mutually, assigning a Central Coordinator of PCC, addressing cross-cultural issues, building flexibility into contracts, developing a PPC framework for interaction, and assessing emergent conditions are some of the key conclusions that the paper would like to make for policymakers and practitioners.

      "Key Findings": "We have distilled five key lessons from this case study. First, it is important to have transparent interactions and clearly defined project priorities, roles and responsibilities among core partners. Second, partners need to engage farmers by using proven-effective, hands-on approaches as a means for farmers to build trust in the technology. Third, positive interactions with the technology are important; increased yields and secure income attributable to the seed will facilitate trust. Fourth, there is a need for improved communication strategies and\nappropriate media response to obviate unwarranted public perceptions of the project. Finally, the political context cannot be ignored; there is a need to establish trust in both the public and private sector as a means to secure the future of agbiotech PPPs in Egypt.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Most important to the case of Egypt is the effect of the current political climate on project success. There is reason to believe that the current political situation will dictate the ability of public institutions and private\ncorporations to engage in trusting partnerships.",

      "Key Findings": "Various factors undermine and build trust in agbiotech PPPs. Individual and institutional enthusiasm and detailed collaborative agreements stipulating partner roles and responsibilities are likely to enhance trust among partners. On the other hand, negative perceptions propagated by international partners about the capacities of African institutions and scientists, coupled with slow regulatory processes in Africa, are likely to be impediments to trust building.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on the findings of this study, we have derived four key lessons. First, differences in the capacity of the partner institutions and individuals should be respected. Second, technical and infrastructural capacity support for regulatory processes in Africa must be built. Third, detailed agreements and open and transparent partner practices during project implementation are necessary to dispel perceptions of inequality among partners. Fourth, institutional and individual commitment to succeed is important in initiation of the project. These lessons can be used by other agbiotech PPPs as a guide for building trust among partners and with the community.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Overcoming challenges to building trust requires concerted effort throughout all stages of project implementation. Currently, plans are being made to backcross the cowpea strain into a local variety in Nigeria. The development and adoption of the Bt cowpea seed hinges on the adoption of a National Biosafety Law in Nigeria. For countries that have decided to adopt biotech crops, the Nigerian cowpea experiment can be used as a model for other West African nations, and is actually applied as such in Ghana and Burkina Faso, interested in developing a Bt cowpea.",

First, as the end users of GM technology, farmers must be engaged from the start of the project through field demonstrations and educational activities. Second, an effective technology (i.e., the seed) is key to the success of an agbiotech PPP. Third, open communication and full disclosure between private sector companies and government regulatory bodies will build trust and facilitate the regulatory processes. Fourth, enforcing good agronomic practices, including appropriate management of the refuge areas, will serve the interests of both the farmers and the seed companies.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Trust has proven to be a critical factor determining the success of the Bt maize project in South Africa. Distrust of the private sector and of GM technology were cited as major barriers to building trust. The trust-building practices described in this case study have often served to overcome these barriers; however, erosion of trust was also present. The success of the project has been, and will continue to be, dependent upon the concerted effort of the farmers, government, and private sector players in the establishment and maintenance of trust.",

Awareness creation about IRMA’s anticipated products raised the end users’ expectations, which were unfulfilled due to failure to deliver Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-based products, thereby leading to diminished trust between the\nproject and the community.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Four key issues have been identified from the results of the study. First, the inability to deliver the intended products to the end user diminished stakeholders’ trust and interest in the project. Second, full and\nhonest disclosure of information by partners when entering into project agreements is crucial to ensuring progress in a project. Third, engaging stakeholders and creating awareness immediately at the project’s inception contributes to trust building. Fourth, public sector goodwill combined with private sector technology and skills are necessary for a successful partnership. These findings may serve as a useful guide for building and fostering trust among partners in other agbiotech PPPs in sub-Saharan Africa.",

      "Document Title": "The Dilemma of Public–Private Partnerships as a Vehicle for the Provision of Regional Transport Infrastructure Development in Africa",
      "Document Summary": "This article explores the dilemma associated with the adoption of Public-Private Partnerships (“PPP”) as a mechanism for the provision of regional transport infrastructure in Africa. While sourcing infrastructure provision through the PPP the mechanism has significant advantages, it is however also embedded with a complex financial, contractual, and legal process. First, it explores the theoretical assumptions that inform PPP based on ideologies within law and development debates. It argues that theoretically, PPPs are reflective of the neoliberal policy set. Against the trajectory of governance in Africa, it critically foregrounds insights that are derivable from an application of Path Dependency theory to the institutional change which comes with the planned adoption of PPP at the regional level. These insights are essential considerations for policy experts to bear in mind both while designing the regional institutional framework for PPP and during the implementation stage. Secondly, although most of the past initiatives for the provision of regional infrastructure have fallen short of their flamboyant development policy goals, the article argues that the recently initiated Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (“PIDA”) provides new hope for the future of infrastructure development in the continent. The article contends that PIDA offers a legitimate platform that with the requisite support of the regional economic initiatives can generate the enabling environment for the implementation of successful regional PPP infrastructure projects.",
      "Key Findings": "The point that this article advances is that in the design process, sufficient attention must be given to the local peculiarities of African society in introducing PPP for regional projects as envisaged. In particular, factors such as political, economic, financial, social/cultural, environmental, technical, and geographic have a significant role to play in the institutional design and coordination of the PPP scheme. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "To realize the maximum regional benefits from PIDA’s drive for regional infrastructure development, the continental and regional effort must necessarily be complemented with positive responses from the national governments to ensure that there are adequate linkage roads between the remote areas and the industrialized cities where much more reliable network of roads linking other countries are being proposed.",

      "Key Findings": "Overall, the evaluation concluded that while UNHCR has been largely successful in providing access to technology through Community Technology Access programs (CTAs), this access alone is not enough to achieve significant improvements in education quality or livelihoods opportunities. Rather, if substantial impact is to be realized in all CTA centres, expertise and strategic planning at various levels are required to ensure that the content of CTA programming fits each specific context and effectively meets the needs of persons of concern. To this end, it is crucial to have continuous “buy-in” at the field level and an experienced implementing partner that can support UNHCR staff in identifying the resources required and available to bridge gaps in targeted content preparation and program delivery, based on market and socio-economic assessments, through local or regional solutions. Nevertheless, the fundamental value of basic IT literacy and access to information and social networking, which is already being provided by CTAs around the world, should not be underestimated. Rather, the concrete recommendations spelled out in this evaluation will only strengthen the ability of UNHCR to build on these accomplishments and to use both new and existing CTAs to their fullest potential in empowering persons of concern. UNHCR’s Livelihoods Unit is currently developing a new CTA strategy, which is still in its early phases. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The evaluation recommends strategic mapping of local labor market and income-generating opportunities and the tailoring of Community Technology Access (CTA) programming to offer the most relevant skills training for each particular situation. Furthermore, greater synergies could be promoted between CTAs both within and across countries. \n\nSome preliminary ideas for change include: virtualizing services (making them available online); alternative approaches for running CTAs (including renting time at existing Internet cafes and/or privatizing centres); building capacity for training course creation at the local level; increasing on-site learning assistance; and engaging with education content marketplaces. This new CTA strategy, along with UNHCR’s increased focus on using innovation and technology to benefit persons of concern, indicate bright prospects for CTAs.",

      "Document Title": "Public-Private Partnership Options toward Achieving Universal Health Coverage in the Philippine Setting",
      "Document Summary": "This paper aims to define what PPPs are, their application in the health sector, and to distinguish them from all other public-private interactions. It presents representative case studies or models of PPP practices in health. Furthermore, it aims to provide decision-makers and stakeholders with a methodology for developing health PPPs. Specifically, the study discusses the rationale of health PPPs, defines PPPs in health, differentiates PPPs from other public-private interactions, provides representative case studies of PPP options in health, and proposes mechanisms for approaching PPP development in health at various levels of care. In the paper, public-private investment partnerships (PPIPs) have been described as health-related PPPs that are potentially transformative for underperforming government-run health systems. These comprise long-term, highly structured relationships between the public and private sectors designed to achieve significant and sustainable improvements to healthcare systems at national or subnational levels. They expressly address public policy objective/s and usually follow the Design-Build-Operate-Deliver model.",
      "Key Findings": "This article describes that PPIPs provide a concrete option for achieving universal health coverage. Their integrated approach works within the healthcare delivery system, improving overall efficiency instead of simply bridging gaps. Such an approach further brings about private sector participation and accountability under the usual PPIP’s Design-Build-Operate-Deliver model with risk transfer to the private sector. The presence of robust government reviews and independent monitoring is ensured because ownership of assets remains with the government during the life of the PPIP. The PPIPs aim for system-wide efficiency gains and the delivery of integrated clinical and nonclinical services without putting the patient at risk of financial hardship while providing predictable costs to the government. If adequately implemented, PPIPs may responsively address the three dimensions of universal health coverage (population coverage, quality service coverage, and financial risk protection).",
      "Key Recommendations": "There are certain elements that must be present for a PPP to thrive in:\n\n A comprehensive health plan should clarify the role of PPPs in the health system and in attaining universal health coverage. \n\n A legal framework is necessary to protect the interests of both the public and private sector and to make them liable if the objective of the PPP is not attained. Policies should be in place to serve as guidelines on how to go about the partnership, ensuring that there is enough incentive for private investors.\n\n A regulatory framework—specifically a controlling body—is essential to keep track of projects, to police partners, and to assist in technical aspects of the partnership, among others.\n\nBoth public and private sectors must be ready and willing to enter into the partnership. This means that the public sector must have the capacity to handle the technical requirements of the project, including regulation and enforcement, and the private sector is able to meet the quality standards required to achieve better health outcomes.

      "Key Findings": "For doses, SMGL implemented many activities in year 1, including the following:\n\n• 1,548 individuals trained as safe mother action group (SMAG)members\n• 236,483 birth plans distributed\n• 93 Change Champions trained\n• 2,027 Mama Packs (containing cloth diapers, diaper fasteners,\ntraditional chitenge cloth, laundry bars, bath soap, and baby hat)\ndistributed to women at facility delivery\n• 94 facilities upgraded to BEmONC capacity (some still unable to\nperform vacuum assisted deliveries)\n• 199 health workers trained in EmONC\n• 256 health workers trained in SmartCare\n\nIn terms of reach, for the intervention districts, nearly 90% of women who delivered at facilities had heard of SMGL, mostly from radio broadcasts and health providers. Almost 70% of women in SMGL districts used at least one intervention, with 25% reporting the use of transport vouchers. Providers in SMGL districts were twice as likely to have received obstetric training during the past year compared to those in non-SMGL districts.\n\nThere were also outlying dynamic effects: SMGL raised awareness of maternal mortality within and beyond focus districts. While it also had mostly positive “spillover” effects on the broader\nhealth system (e.g., service delivery, medicine procurement,\ninformation systems). Women in the community were enthusiastic about SMGL—specifically the work of the SMAGs. Most women who delivered at home said they did so due to\nthe sudden onset of labor, lack of transportation, and concerns\nabout disrespectful treatment. Women also reported social pressure to deliver in facilities; some who delivered at home felt stigmatized. Lastly Women and local leaders confirmed that those who delivered at home were made to pay penalties in many villages.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Commit to five years – with a clear transition plan: SMGL partners should make minimum commitments of five years to enable appropriate planning, engagement of local ministries, sequencing of interventions, and planning for sustainability.\n2. Think in terms of health system packages and not isolated\ninterventions: Investments in surgically-equipped facilities, medicine supply chains, health workers, and clinical skill acquisition are mutually- reinforcing and essential for creating a culture of competence necessary for high quality care.\n3. Training is not enough – consider other cost-effective models\nfor improving care quality: Trainings were the most rapidly and extensively implemented activities of SMGL.\n4. Focus on “last mile” women: Even with expansion of obstetric\nfacilities and transport solutions, many women in rural areas will live too far to reach facilities for delivery.\n5. Clarify the SMGL governance structure – globally and in host countries: At the global level, the SMGL Leadership Council should define a governance structure with clear roles and responsibilities for funding and implementation.",

Based on the findings and results, certain conclusions are drawn about the performance of the TILO project. ",
      "Key Findings": "This case study finds that In SBR Primary schools and TSS Prep schools, students trained both by “TILO Trained Teachers” and by “TILO Locally Trained teachers” improved significantly in their average midyear marks compared to the baseline. The academic performance of TILO students in both SBR Primary and TSS Prep schools showed significant improvement over the intervention as measured by their average mid-year marks. Furthermore, both schools and Idaras significantly increased their use of technology for making data-driven decisions and both teachers’ and students’ perceptions of technology use in the classroom improved significantly over the TILO project.\n\nLastly, while technology was certainly useful to teachers in their teaching, it was clear from the results that the teachers were able to use the technology in appropriate ways because they had first been trained on how to teach well.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Replicate the Student Marks Study in 2014 and 2015 in TILO schools which have not received further interventions in order to see if the impact of the TILO activities have been sustained.\nInclude other relevant stakeholders (such as Idara and Muderiya education officers as well as school principals) in interventions involving training of teachers. This makes a big difference in terms of securing their buy-in and engagement during the intervention, as well as their interest in and ability to continue supporting the initiatives after the end of the project.\nConsider ways to decentralize decision-making about the allocation of financial and technology resources to ensure the sustainability of TILO interventions.\nUse a phased approach to implementing interventions so that adjustments can be made to address any problems identified in a pilot before the model is rolled out widely.",

      "Document Title": "Grassroots Philanthropy: Fighting the Power Asymmetries of Aid in Rural Burundi",
      "Document Summary": "The goal of this paper is to promote a model of reciprocal philanthropy in which those directing philanthropic resources and those benefiting from those resources are deeply enmeshed. The paper argues that grassroots participation and leadership are still rarely encouraged or practiced in philanthropic endeavors. Arguing on the weaknesses of traditional philanthropic mode and public-private partnership, the paper has pointed out the need to shift the partnership paradigm from PPP to social-public-private partnerships as a fundamental need and the urgency to move from an age of government to one of governance, a shift that encourages the engagement and leadership of affected community members.\n\nThe paper has presented a Village Health Work (VHW) as a model of this newly proposed partnership structure where engagement of community members on the ground is significant, donating their land, labor, and time to enact social change regardless of the government's support. The local community continues to stand at the helm of VHW's program implementation and management. They have become VHW’s most knowledgeable development experts. Today, VHW has cultivated a truly social-public-private partnership. Burundi's president, Pierre Nkurunziza, publicly announced that \"of all the public and private sector organizations and programs in the country, VHW is the best of all.\" ",
      "Key Findings": "Combined with the support of private sector actors, who have provided medical donations and in-kind donations as physicians, teachers, lawyers, and agronomists, VHW has cultivated a social-public-private partnership with the social sphere intentionally at the forefront. Social-public-private partnerships can organically provide a secure and predictable environment that clarifies power relationships within the village, between villages, and towards local and central government bodies. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Accordingly, social-public-private partnerships are an urgently needed expansion of existing PPPs. As such, it is critical that the community members intended to benefit from these partnerships are continually encouraged to serve at the forefront of decision-making processes. VHW proactively makes room for grassroots philanthropists. This paper finally, advocates for social-public-private partnerships that promote grassroots leadership. Only when the international aid community moves beyond the mere rhetoric of partnership and puts in place actual partnerships as vehicles of community-driven development will there be sustainable progress.",

      "Document Summary": "This article focuses on the involvement of a new for-profit actor — a private tourism dive operator — in addressing illegal fishing in a small island archipelago in eastern Indonesia, where tackling illegal fishing through traditional state-centered approaches has proven difficult and largely ineffective. The case study demonstrates that the dive operator has been able to employ conventional enforcement methods such as patrolling and the capture of illegal fishers, in combination with alternative approaches to addressing the root causes of illegal fishing. It also explores the relationship of the dive operator with civil society actors, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and various state agencies involved in maritime security and conservation governance in the area. ",
      "Key Findings": "With a particular focus on the dive operator’s relationship with government agencies, the case study shows that local governments are collaborating with private actors and providing opportunities for new kinds of enforcement agents since they themselves lack sufficient resources to patrol waters effectively. The dive operator, however, operates only within a space granted by the district government and must invest considerably in this relationship to maintain his position.\n\nFinally, the paper reflects on how the roles assumed by new private actors can change pre-existing structures, perceptions, and partnerships; ultimately forming new political landscapes that host new alliances and address specific negative pressures more acutely. In doing so, the analysis refrains from making normative judgments of the role and relations that have emerged within the political arena concerning illegal fishing. Rather it seeks to use the case study to inform our broader understanding of private sector involvement in security provision, albeit in the context of environmental management.",

      "Document Summary": "This report summarizes the meeting outcome of the ‘African Leadership for Child Survival—A Promise Renewed’ Meeting held on January 16-18, 2013, in Addis Ababa. Ministers of Health and experts from across Africa came together with peers and global experts to ensure child survival is at the forefront of the social development agendas across the continent and renew the focus of African leaders to galvanize their own country’s efforts and sustain the gains made over the last two decades. The meeting focused on scientific evidence for high-impact interventions that can accelerate progress shared; progress in achieving national Millennium Development Goals for child survival reviewed; approaches (best practices) for scaling up high-impact interventions for newborn and child health reviewed; and galvanizing momentum for the country led national Child Survival Action Plans.",
      "Key Findings": "One of every four babies born is born in Africa with half of these babies are born at home. It is often the poorest mothers who give birth at home where they are alone and without assistance should complications occur. Meanwhile, half of all child deaths occur in Africa; a total of 6.9 million children died globally in 2011 and about half of these deaths are newborn deaths due mainly to preterm delivery, birth complications and newborn infections. There has been rapid socioeconomic development in many countries in the past decade, but stunting has not diminished (especially in sub-Saharan Africa). The study finds that there are three key determinants for stunting: food security, access to health services, and care of the child.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To accelerate progress we need targeted and effective implementation of high impact interventions. Dramatic reductions in preventable child deaths can be achieved through concerted action in five critical areas, outlined in the Global Roadmap:\n1. Geography: Increase efforts in the areas where the most deaths occur, prioritizing budgets and committing to action plans to end preventable child deaths.\n2. High Burden Populations: Focus country health systems on scaling-up access for underserved populations, to include rural and low income groups.\n3. High Impact Solutions: Focus on the primary causes of child death.\n4. Gender Equality: Invest beyond health programs to include educating girls and boys, empowering women and men, and inclusive economic growth.\n5. Mutual Accountability and Financing: Unify around a shared goal and common metrics.",

      "Document Summary": "The main purpose of this end-of-project performance evaluation report is to provide USAID/Armenia with an objective analysis of USAID assistance to Armenia’s energy sector under the $5.9 million Energy Security and Regional Integration (ESRI) project, undertaken over the period 2009-2012. This report explores answers to address five Key Questions (KQs) that are; i) Is there evidence that the independent expert services to the Government of Armenia for the new Nuclear Power Plant contributed to procedures and activities implemented in accordance with the western safety and environmental standards in the preparation of documentation for the New Nuclear Power Plant?, ii) Is there evidence that the scenarios of power system integration contributed to an increased understanding of renewable energy development tendencies in the region among the main stakeholders?, iii) Is there evidence that the regional integration task contributed to an increase in regional cooperation with Georgia?, iv) What do stakeholders’ groups see as the results of the project?, and v) How relevant was the intervention in terms of Armenia’s priorities in the energy sector?",
      "Key Findings": "The evaluation findings reveal that the process of developing the new NPP was slower than anticipated, but the progress was significant in, i) support provided to the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MOENR) in holding public hearings and in preparing vital documents, ii) support for Armenian Nuclear Regulatory Agency (ANRA) in the development of a safety guide for licensing purposes based on Western standards, as well as provision of safety analysis software and training and iii) development of curricula at two State universities in nuclear engineering and nuclear physics that are currently being adopted. \n\nIt is further highlighted that renewable energy in the technical and economic simulations of power system integration contributed somewhat to an increased understanding of renewable energy development tendencies in the region among the main stakeholders. As a result of the project, agreements have been reached on the parallel operation of the Armenian and Georgian power systems and Armenian-Georgian power exchanges for emergency and unplanned situations. The nuclear and interconnection tasks were perceived as having produced better results by more stakeholders than the renewable energy task. \n\nDespite all the positive changes, the report indicates that the project is somewhat clouded by the long lead time required for development and escalating costs of additional nuclear power, which creates a degree of uncertainty. Given the GOA’s rather inconsistent policy toward renewables, the intervention did not appear to have been so relevant in terms of Armenia’s current energy priorities. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Continued partnership between US and Armenia government on Armenia's energy sector.\n\n- Develop a least-cost power sector plan for the country.\n\n- Develop and implement a strategy for development of a new nuclear plant.\n\n- Support for developing policies to promote renewable energy technologies.\n\n- Expanding regional trade with Georgia such as signing commercial trading agreements.",

      "Document Title": "Public-Private Partnership in Education: A Ray of Hope for Pakistan",
      "Document Summary": "This paper presents a snapshot of public schools located in a low-income area versus, just a few miles away, the elite private schools catering to high-income families in Pakistan. It outlines the quality of educational services and the challenges that the government-run schools, privately owned, and non-profit-run schools are providing and suggests PPP as one of the best approaches to address some of these challenges. The paper argues that poor conditions of public schools are not the characteristics of every public school in Pakistan, but the conditions observed within this school are not uncommon. While in the elite school all the buildings and classes are built and run-on UNESCO specifications. Between the extremes of the public school and the elite school, one can find islands of hope, such as the Aga Khan School, Kharadhar, which runs on a low budget but provides world-class education, this paper evaluates it as an opportunity to make the future of children in Pakistan.  ",
      "Key Findings": "Specific challenges in the Pakistani education system are wide-ranging, from deficiencies in the physical infrastructure of schools to low rates of school participation, particularly for female, rural, and poor children. A growing private school system is also present in Pakistan forcing a large number of\nparents to make financial sacrifices to send their children to these schools. These schools are of variable quality, from elite schools with internationally recognized standards to more affordable private schools. However, some of the private schools are of dubious quality. \n\nThe paper highlights that even with formidable challenges, PPP can make a positive difference in the educational goals of a country. Public and private sectors alike must be willing and committed to the concept and its implementation. In the case of Pakistan, go-between organizations, such as the Sindh Education Foundation, are useful. The success of PPP in Sindh results from dedicated leadership and staff at SEF, who are working through the difficulties at various levels. The PPP model in Sindh has been a success in increasing enrollment, improving gender parity, and enhancing the quality of education. None of these goals could be achieved by either sector independently. ",

      "Document Summary": "This case study report provides a synthesis of the issues identified in the field, addresses the Iloilo context to provide background for the reader, defines both current non-climate and climate stressors on Iloilo water resources, and anticipates impacts of climate change on the water sector with special focus on water governance issues. This plays a particularly important role in water security in the Philippines, Metro Iloilo, and the TAW, and lays out some principles of adaptation specific to the metro Iloilo area. Finally, this presents specific actions proposed by the research team to improve water security in Metro Iloilo.",
      "Key Findings": "The key to taking action to address climate change in Iloilo is to focus on the primary objectives of stakeholders in the area – promoting tourism, commercial development, and agriculture. The article highlights that resources are extremely limited in Metro Iloilo. Given such resource scarcity, water security strategies for adapting to climate change must provide benefits today as well as under future climate conditions.\n\nAt a minimum, climate change should be integrated into the decision-making process of existing institutions while most actions that can address climate change in Metro Iloilo also address other non-climate stressors and natural climate variability. Many of the existing vulnerabilities of Metro Iloilo require a sustained focus of attention and resources over a period of many years.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Evaluate Resources: Develop a Long-term Water Security and Climate Change Monitoring Program; Evaluate and Enhance Groundwater for the Metro Iloilo Area\n\n2. Improve Knowledge Management: Enhance Monitoring Network for Supply, Quality, and Flooding; Develop an Information Clearinghouse for All Water-Related Data in Metro Iloilo and the TAW; Develop Capacity for Information-based Management Decisions among Municipal and Provincial Resource Managers",

The report points out the important progress in implementing core SMGL activities in both countries, with a slower start for procurement of transport vehicles and infrastructure improvements. In its six-month inception phase, both countries trained large numbers of community mobilizers to promote facility deliveries and birth planning. Considerable efforts were made to improve the quality of obstetric care in both countries. \n\n",
      "Key Findings": "Two key success factors cited by Zambian and Ugandan stakeholders were the strong alignment between SMGL and national health policies and well-functioning national partnerships—between the Ministry of Health, the US Government, and a range of implementing partner organizations—that formed to implement SMGL.\n\nThe report highlights the challenges that the SMGL project encountered and several were related to the short time frame for the first phase. Launching so many activities in a short time required a huge organizational effort and participation of many partners—driving up transaction costs and making coordination difficult. As a result, there was duplication of some activities and delays in funding and logistics that prevented timely delivery of some inputs. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Engage communities as change agents\n2. Invest in the health system triad\n3. Expand the focus beyond 24 hours\n4. Develop and test solutions to address the bottlenecks of human resource shortages and transport\n5. Coordinate around a single plan\n6. Commit to five years—with a clear transition plan\n7. Collect (a few) standard measures to optimize implementation\n8. Harness the private sector: Reducing maternal death requires an “all hands on deck” approach. ",

      "Document Summary": "Published by the USAID in 2013, the Strategic Analysis of Supermarket Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) focuses on answering four overarching questions and several sub-questions regarding a wide range of USAID and non-USAID projects that included partnerships with supermarket chains: i) How do USAID-Supermarket Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) in Central America compare and contrast?, ii) What is the ideal model for private partnership with USAID, focusing on partnership elements/structure, and sustainability?, iii) What are the lessons in comparing regional partnerships versus bi-lateral partnerships with an eye toward future partnerships?, and iv) How do Supermarket Public Private Partnerships meet strategic development outcomes & objectives?\n\nThis report concludes with a summary of best practices, lessons learned, and recommendations regarding Supermarket PPPs. The report also includes a partnership ‘typology’ through which to consider partnership development with supermarkets in the region, building on concrete examples of successful (and unsuccessful) partnership elements and models from USAID and non-USAID projects. These conclusions are applicable beyond the realm of food security and beyond Central America.",
      "Key Findings": "The paper found that projects need to consider the value chain as a whole, working with middlemen, SME suppliers, processing firms, and a portfolio of different buyers (supermarkets, exporters, processing firms, and local markets). Partnerships, which create significant shared value, are more likely to be sustained than those anchored purely in public relations-driven CSR while partnerships focused on improving farmer production through capacity-building efforts must also be supported by tangible investments. Solutions for financing (for farmers, SMEs, etc.) are available and should be included in partnership development. Lastly, every partnership implementation approach should include a sustainability plan that describes a scenario beyond donor involvement and mechanisms for self-replication.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In examining USAID’s experience in developing supermarket partnerships, SSG concludes that the optimal sequence in establishing collaboration should be:\n1. When a public or private actor proposes partnership, determine which local or regional projects would benefit from deeper collaboration with the involved partners, currently or in the future.\n2. Assess the value of pursuing an agreement with the given supermarket chain and decide whether it should be framed at the global, regional, or local level.\n3. Develop a list of objectives for the proposed partnership and discuss it with the partner’s CSR and business-related departments.",

",
      "Key Findings": "The PALM Project made a significant contribution to the advancement of pension reform in Armenia. Communication among stakeholders regarding PALM management, budget, and priorities was sometimes imperfect, leading to increased transaction costs and frustration. To address this challenge, the report suggests that the USAID staff and implementation partners should re-double efforts toward clear communication with counterparts at every level from the outset of any future project in the pension area concerning the purpose and mandate of the project, the priorities, and the constraints that exist in terms of budget and other resources, laws, rules, and regulations. The contribution of the PALM Project to the development of pension legislation was significant. The legal basis for each of the four pillars of the proposed pension system was established, and most required regulations were drafted. \n\nWhile the senior staff of SESA had a positive view of the PALM Project and USAID support, they expressed frustration with that the PALM Project as well. This was an area in which improved communication about the mandate, role, funding, and capacity of USAID and PALM might have been helpful.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. USAID staff and implementation partners should re-double efforts toward clear communication with counterparts at every level from the outset of any future project in the pension area concerning the purpose and mandate of the project, the priorities, and the constraints that exist in terms of budget and other resources, laws, rules and regulations.\n2. The follow-on pension reform project should have a strong, national, and full-time pension legislation expert.\n3. USAID should work with MLSI to help develop staff below the senior level to serve as active counterparts to the follow-on pension reform project, including a skilled pension modeling expert.\n4. If, in the future, USAID determines that it should develop significant labor market or employment programs in Armenia, an evaluation component should be built into the projects from the beginning, including the collection of relevant data before the beginning and as the project is being implemented.\n5. Care should be taken in developing the SOW for future USAID projects to identify linkages between results and expected outcomes in as concrete a way as possible and provide some guidance concerning how the contractor and the USAID mission at the outset of the project may be able to develop measures of accomplishment.",

      "Document Summary": "Latin America: Nutrition and Health Claims Workshop for Functional Food Companies is a summary of the workshop report published by the World Food Regulation Review (WFRR). The report highlights that the workshop is intended to help functional food companies successfully navigate Latin America’s nutrition and health claims regulations. The workshop highlights regulatory trends in nutrition and health claims across Latin America. It focuses on the key elements companies must be aware of when planning region-wide marketing strategies to access the top emerging markets in the region. As a part of this process, the report briefly discusses the agreement that Canada and Costa Rica Signed for the Organic Food Arrangement, which the report considers as an outcome of an extensive analysis of both countries’ production and certification systems. ",
      "Key Findings": "Private sector participation in the ASEAN Economic Community integration process will help ensure the development of regulatory frameworks on par with international practices, EAS Strategic Advice Managing Director, Pushpanathan Sundram, said April 19. Speaking in Singapore at the launch of new food industry association, the ASEAN Food and Beverage Alliance (AFBA), Mr Sundram said that the organisation has the potential to play a key role in harmonisation of food policies and standards in ASEAN that enhance the trade of safe, high quality food. The AFBA launch was attended by senior ASEAN officials and leading experts from the region's food and beverage industry.",

      "Document Summary": "The project AIDE Performance Evaluation 2009-2013 is a project evaluation report produced and published by USAID in 2013. The report presents the overall performance of the AIDE project against the set project goal, objectives, and result indicators. Finally, it offers recommendations based on findings from the evaluation. ",
      "Key Findings": "Following the description in the report, the project seemed to respond well to the challenge of the diversity of its components. The project showed resilience in keeping staff and not losing too much momentum considering the closing of the Academy for Educational Development and the takeover of its projects by Family Health International, FHI360. Greater collaboration between the USAID/Djibouti education and economic development offices could have potentially allowed for greater resources and technical expertise to be provided to this component. The impact of project interventions remains fragile, especially in rural schools, where interventions requiring parental participation need to be systematized, intensified, prolonged, and better coordinated with the work of school performance inspectors and school directors. The most significant impact of the project is having supported the development of a role and the furnishing of a physical space for parent participation in the management of schools. Even if some parents are less equipped than others to implement their end of the parent-teacher relationship bargain, it is clear that the project AIDE has helped to instill the participatory parent mentality among the communities in which it has been implemented. USAID/Djibouti’s support of Project AIDE to promote community involvement in schools, through the broadcasting of roundtable discussions on television has had a positive impact on communities’ perceptions of the value of parent participation. The pilot project, like the school-based training, has been developed and can be replicated in all regions and the capital now. The speed of implementation varied depending on the project component. Great progress has been made in maintaining the results of Djibouti’s efforts to dramatically increase the percentage of girls attending school.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on the findings above, the report recommends preparing the project AIDE close-out plan. This includes the development of case studies highlighting its successes, recommendations for making links with other donors who may be interested in continuing support for different components, and recommendations to the MENFOP on areas where they can take over ownership of key components parts. Any future programming plans for sustaining interventions at the regional level should be built in from the start and include a role for the Ministry of National Education and Professional Training (MENFOP) at the central level to prepare it for post-project continuation. Future project designs should include content that ensures that MENFOP policy, regulations, and institutional structures are well understood by the implementer, and will contribute measurably to the achievement of project goals. Any future follow-up project should have a more predominant Monitoring and Evaluation component included in the RFA. Community participation in the maintenance and support of schools’ goals and interests could be dynamized and rendered sustainable through the inclusion of a community resource or liaison person. ",

      "Document Summary": "Bridging the “Pioneer Gap”: The Role of Accelerators in Launching High-Impact Enterprises is the first quantitative assessment report of its kind and represents the first quantitative assessment of the impact accelerator landscape with data from 52 organizations globally. This was collected by ANDE and Village Capital between November 2012 and February 2013. This study identified several key variables that are related to the success and failure of accelerators, as well as several key gaps that may be holding back accelerator success. It has outlined key findings below and provides recommendations in light of these findings.",
      "Key Findings": "The report's findings are summarized as follows: \n\n• The Landscape of Accelerators: While nearly 75% of all accelerators in our sample rely on some level of philanthropic support, about one-third are structured as for-profits, suggesting that they expect to develop sustainable revenue streams in the future. \n\n• Enterprise Pipeline and Selection: Employment, economic development, health, clean energy, and agriculture are the most common impact areas that accelerators focus on. \n\n• Services and Benefits: The majority of accelerators provide the same set of core services – mentorship, access to investors, networks of partners, and business skills development. \n\n• Accelerator Networks: Accelerators also seek to develop formal partnerships with a range of different types of organizations, including impact investors, commercial investors, foundations,\ngovernments, and universities. \n\n• Metrics and Evaluation: While the majority of accelerators collect financial data, almost one-third do not collect any social performance data. \n\n• Measuring Accelerator Performance: We found that selectivity and partnerships with in-country commercial investors are  associated with higher accelerator performance. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Invest in platforms and systems to encourage and enable quality data collection from the enterprises you support,\n• Collect data from all enterprises that apply to your programs, even the ones that are not accepted or do not receive services, to more comprehensively assess performance against a control group.\n• Collect data from participating enterprises for at least five years post-graduation to track progress and growth over the medium to long-term. \n• Partner with academic institutions and industry associations to develop stronger data collection systems.\n• Strengthen your processes for searching and sourcing ventures for your programs.

      "Document Summary": "This report looks at disabilities holistically, reviews the legal framework and the progress of implementation to identify gaps, and suggests opportunities for future investment both geographically and programmatically. The assessment provides a snapshot of what is happening now in Vietnam’s disability sector. The report attempts to solicit information regarding the current status of disability policy and services to identify successes, challenges, and opportunities. Additionally, the report examines the available data on disability prevalence presented in the 2009 Vietnam Population and Housing Census, the level of public service delivery in the provinces as reported in the Vietnam Provincial Government Public Administration Performance Index (PAPI) 2012, the poverty rate in the provinces based on data in the World Bank 2012 Vietnam Poverty Assessment, and gives recommendations from the three key ministries to help inform the strategic analysis for the possible geographic concentration of United States Government (USG) future investment in disability.  ",
      "Key Findings": "Overall, the assessment found that the coordination enhancement, both within and between key ministries (Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA)), to better clarify the roles and responsibilities of each ministry and at the various levels of implementation to reduce overlap and improve the effective use of limited resources. Human capacity building in leadership, organizational development, and finance at all levels and across all sectors is needed and was requested by ministries, steering committees, institutions, universities, NGOs, and Disabled People’s Organizations (DPOs). The recently granted legal status and recognition of DPOs present an opportunity to improve the involvement of PWD in advocating for resources and full inclusion in society. Equitable access to services and opportunities continues to be a challenge despite improved laws and policies. Beyond the central level, many people are unaware of the Law on Persons with Disabilities and how it should be implemented. In addition, there is also a lack of enforcement leading to inequitable access to public buildings (schools, health centers, hospitals, government buildings, etc.) and transportation making many services unavailable to PWD. ",
      "Key Recommendations": " The soon to be issued Inclusive Education 2015 from MOET requires technical assistance at many levels if it is to be successful.\n Decrease any duplication of efforts with social work training by creating opportunities for collaboration between VNAH and San Jose University/CISCO projects.\n Strengthen NCCD’s coordination role and advocate for its elevation to the national committee.\n Strengthen MOLISA’s ability to enforce the disability law and policies.\n The departure of Atlantic Philanthropies by 2015 will present a gap in support to mental health.",

This report assesses the project’s success, effectiveness, relevance, challenges, and lessons learned, which is considered as a guiding document for USAID/ Tanzania to evaluate the project performance. ",
      "Key Findings": "This evaluation suggests that objectives of the CHAMPION project were too ambitious. Behavior change, especially gender transformation, takes time, continued funding, and intensive commitment from national organizations and donors. CHAMPION worked diligently to achieve its goal of promoting national dialogue on men’s roles to increase gender equity and reduce vulnerability to HIV and other adverse RH outcomes. Its five objectives were to reduce partner and high-risk behaviors, promote fidelity, create an enabling environment for gender-equitable norms, reduce GBV, and\nencourage men to seek clinical health services, and ultimately prevent HIV.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on these findings, the report suggests that the ecological model implemented by the CHAMPION project must be adapted and tested in new projects to demonstrate its efficacy and value. CHAMPION should analyze and use findings to strengthen programming and share the data and analysis to build a robust knowledge base. The target population should be expanded to children and youth as well as to formalize the engagement of leaders of religious and community organizations, local government, and traditional organizations. CHAMPION’s reach should be expanded to rural areas, and institutionalization of gender equity and male involvement messages is essential and should have high priority in future undertakings. ",

      "Document Summary": "Produced at the request of the United States Agency for International Development, this report is a Final Performance Evaluation report of the Reproductive Maternal Newborn Child Health /Health Systems Strengthening Program 2008 – 2013 USAID – CAMBODIA. The report highlights that the increase in uptake of long-term family planning (LT FP) methods in the areas with Maries Stopes International Cambodia and Referral Hospital Antenatal Care (RHAC) LT/PM FP voucher schemes seems to be significant. It is likely that increased awareness and the free access created by these voucher schemes have contributed significantly to reducing previously identified barriers. The time frame and data available did not allow a proper impact, effectiveness, or efficiency evaluation. Both schemes, although with a similar goal, have different promotion strategies, distribution mechanisms, price structures, monitoring mechanisms, etc. A combined evaluation of both projects would allow for some level of impact measurement, as well as sharing the many lessons learned, without necessarily having to lead to standardized approaches. As the LT/PM, the FP voucher scheme is mainly aimed at increasing awareness and sustainability is less of an issue once broad awareness is created. To ensure accessibility in the future, Health Equity Fund could later take over the financing responsibility for these services, at least for the poor.",
      "Key Findings": "Three goals were achieved between 2005 and 2010: (i) maternal mortality rate decreased by 56% (ii) under-five mortality rate decreased by 35% and (iii) use of  modern contraceptive rate increased by 22%.  Prevalence of TB declined in line with USAID Health program.  Other programs targeting malnutrition and health coverage were also successful while family planning services have improved more needs to be done if Cambodia hopes to achieve MDG goals.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Increasingly link EmONC training and supervision activities to measurable health outcomes such as safe deliveries, low/ no bleeding complications, babies with better APGAR scores, low/ no postpartum infections, etc.\n\nAdvocate to the MOH, using the good lessons of the Implementing partners in providing training, to issue appropriate policies and/or guidelines that will transition RMNCH training activities from the usual classroom training modes to “training packages” that utilize simulation models, case practices and include continuing post-training coaching as well as provision of critical supplies and equipment necessary for the application of new skills acquired.\n\nConduct systematic FGDs on why women do not routinely go for PNC to better plan for reasonable actions to address this issue.",

      "Document Summary": "Produced and published at the request of the United States Agency for International Development in July 2013, this report is a final evaluation of the Integrated HIV/AIDs Program (ProVIC) for USAID/Democratic Republic of the Congo. The report determines the effectiveness of the ProVIC program and, in particular, the Champion Community (CC) implementation strategy and also makes recommendations for future community mobilization programming, with an emphasis on Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC).",
      "Key Findings": "The CC approach was intended to mobilize communities to address their HIV/AIDS problems, but in practice, it was a program run by NGOs, and a steering committee with volunteer outreach workers that were highly dependent on the NGOs for their activities. The key approach of involving significant numbers of the population in the community to address their HIV/AIDS problem did not appear to work. However, the steering committee through volunteer outreach, workers did contribute to increasing community HIV/AIDS awareness and testing. Community mobilization has an important role to play in HIV programs in the DRC. However, the CC Model as such is not the most effective strategy to use where HIV is not a priority problem. Large integrated projects may compromise quality, and while a single management structure reduces coordination problems, program harmonization and community clinic linkages remain a problem.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on the above findings, the report advises placing zonal health centers at the center of programming to include clinical services, systems strengthening, and a robust community component. It suggests keeping the community involved and strengthening Ministry of Health (MOH) health committees. For sustainability, integrate the CCSCs into the Zonal-level Health Committees; add activities for HIV and promotion of PMTCT; increase the number of voluntary outreach workers for the extra activities; strengthen the zone supervisory and oversight roles for the health committee and outreach workers. To promote sustainability, the report recommends USAID to encourage the state to provide free education as required by the constitution; promote the use of block grants; and promote community support and school IGAs for school fee waivers for OVC. To ensure access to free health care, healthcare funding should be pooled and paid directly to health facilities to be used to support all OVC in the health zone. Strengthen services to include: (a) treatment for opportunistic infections as well as ARV; (b) provision for the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) counts for all PWLHA; (c) clinic-based and community-based support for adherence to ARVs; and (d) promotion and strengthening of self-support groups. Promote the integration of clinic-based services and the use of mobile HIV testing units for key populations. Improve linkages between community- and clinic-based services through innovative mechanisms that strengthen referral systems.",

      "Document Summary": "Meeting Rural Demand: A Case for Combining Community-Based Distribution and Social Marketing of Injectable Contraceptives in Tigray, Ethiopia is a case study report, which proposes a model for increasing access to injectable contraceptives in rural settings by using community-based distributors as social marketing agents and incorporating financing systems to improve sustainability. \n\nThe model lays out the foundation with a broader understanding of private sector strategies of demand generation, cost recovery, and willingness to pay. Under this model, community-based distribution workers are incentivized to increase sales, and programs are potentially less undermined by attrition. In this model, the public health system is directly involved in supervision and monitoring and highlights the importance of private-public partnerships to the feasibility of this model. ",
      "Key Findings": "Forty-four percent of CBRHAs were providing family planning methods at the time of the training and 96% believed providing injectable contraceptives would improve their services. By October 2012, 137 CBRHAs had successfully completed training and provided 2541 injections. Of total injections, 47% were provided to new users of injectable contraceptives. Approximately 31% of injections were given for free to the poorest women, including adolescents.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Insights gained from the first year of implementation of the model provide a framework for further expansion in Tigray, Ethiopia. Our experience highlights how program planners can tailor interventions to match family planning preferences and create more sustainable contraceptive service provision with greater impact.",

      "Document Summary": "This case study documents the experiences of the Nepal Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), a Nepali pharmaceutical company—Lomus Pharmaceuticals Private Limited—and two USAID‐supported technical assistance projects, in the development of a chlorhexidine product and program. This case study maps out the development of that partnership in a PPP model and examines the issues confronted, and the lessons learned. In this report, the success of PPP is assessed from a variety of perspectives, including the clarity of communication, goals, and responsibilities between the partners; efficient and fair sharing of risk; public sector cost reduction; incentives; monitoring mechanisms and dispute resolution; and political support within the enabling regulatory environment. This case study analyses the perceptions of various actors on the involvement of Lomus in the government’s chlorhexidine program and reviews the prospects for such partnerships in health. \n\n",
      "Key Findings": "The case study suggests that as private company has to look at long‐term benefits to fully contribute to the national interest, having an explicit market and demand and scaleup plan helps the private sector see the potential even when the market is initially small. The importance of engaging the right stakeholders cannot be overstated. It is important to explore options so as to further innovate and so that better solutions can be found; limiting a program to its initial set‐up is not sufficient for achieving the best results. Remaining flexible and open creates opportunities.",

      "Document Title": "The Two Worlds of Humanitarian Innovation",
      "Key Findings": "Innovation has rapidly emerged as one the most widely discussed themes within the humanitarian world. However, in many of the existing debates, innovation is poorly understood or based on limited research. Furthermore, existing work on humanitarian innovation can broadly be considered as occupying two very different ‘worlds’ of innovation: one ‘top-down’ and the other ‘bottom-up’. The overwhelming majority of humanitarian innovation work occupies the former of these worlds. It focuses mainly on how to improve organisational response, making it more efficient, effective, and sustainable. Attempting to move beyond the rhetoric of ‘bottom-up’ language, this paper has begun to elaborate what bottom-up innovation means in general, and for the humanitarian context in particular. The aim is not to replace the role of external interventions but to offer ways in which an enabling environment can be developed that better facilitates and works within the existing adaptive capacities of communities and their wider networks.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The paper includes the following humanitarian innovation research framework: \n\n1. Define the problem or identify the opportunity\n2. Find a potential solution\n3. Test, adapt, and use the solution\n4. Appropriately scale the solution",

The report covers the activities carried out from November 18, 2009, through August 31, 2013, with a summary of achievements and key lessons learned. \n\nUSAID awarded the TAFA contract in November 2009 to a consortium consisting of Chemonics International Inc., which was the prime implementer, Economic Integration Forum, Inc., Overseas Strategic Consulting, Ltd., and Management Systems International, Inc. Building on the foundation of TAFA, USAID awarded the TAFA II contract, which started on November 16, 2012, and ran through August 31, 2013. Since most TAFA activities transitioned seamlessly into TAFA II, this report covers the activities of both projects and uses “TAFA” when referring to the activities of both projects. \n\nThe report provides the details of i) Trade Policy Liberalization, ii) Customs Reform, and iii) Trade Facilitation as project components under both the project phases. The report highlights that from its start in November 2009 through its completion in August 2013, USAID’s TAFA project worked to rebuild Afghanistan’s traditional role as a great trading nation.",
      "Key Findings": "TAFA supported Afghanistan’s journey toward accession to the WTO, widely recognized as the engine for enabling broad-based reforms and improving national competitiveness. As a result of its  partnership with TAFA, the Afghan government made steady  progress toward membership in the WTO, participating in its four working party meetings and receiving support from WTO members for a fast-tracked accession that is expected before the end of 2014.\n\nTAFA advised the Afghan government on legislative reforms to create a conducive trade and investment regulatory regime that complies with WTO and other internationally accepted rules, principles, and best practices.With TAFA assistance and tireless coordination with relevant ministries, Afghanistan has embarked on major policy, legal, and institutional reforms, consisting of 26 pieces of legislation.",

      "Key Findings": "The results of this paper show that private sector engagement receives little attention in National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). This may have three explanations: an intentional approach of least developed countries to avoid a distraction from the necessity to scale up public funding; a lack of awareness of the potential of the private sector; the NAPA formulation guidelines focus on the public sector in the context of public financing, potentially causing path dependency. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "While creating an enabling environment, governments should think of the private sector's motivation to engage in adaptation. First, many private firms will have to adapt their operations to stay in business or maintain their level of profit under changing climatic conditions. The second motivation for the private sector to engage in adaptation is new business opportunities. ",

In fact, the Centers model in Namibia was envisioned as an innovative answer to the recognized need for community members to reach their own communities with health promotion, HIV/AIDS awareness, referrals, data collection, and provision of limited services. Unfortunately, the Centership model did not work in either community as originally designed, but it evolved to specific local solutions for the two communities. . ",
      "Key Findings": "At midline, the activities in both locations were floundering and would have ended; however, both USAID and AIDSTAR-Two were willing to adapt the approach. The willingness to be flexible and adapt the response based on local learning supports USAID’s collaboration, learning, and adaptation approach, which promotes monitoring, review of data, and learning from the implementation process to promote a living strategy and course correction to adapt projects to the local situation. In light of this, the report provides the recommendations that the USAID and AIDSTAR-Two should consider for future undertakings",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. As modeled in this project, involve MOHSS Regional Director and Regional Health Management team and community leaders from inception to foster ownership. \n2. Use a community capacity-enhancement approach and facilitation process to stimulate community awareness of its own strengths to foster ownership and lead to sustainability.\n3. Start with network and partner mapping to ensure informed decisions and understanding of the environmental context and presence of other potential partners.\n4. From the CHVs: Be clear about the role and expectations of volunteers from the beginning. \n5. From the CHVs: Foster a team sense of working together for the community.",

      "Document Title": "Toward a New Paradigm of Sustainable Development: Lessons from the Partnership for Growth",
      "Document Summary": "This paper examines a more direct route to sustainable development outcomes for the U.S. government, which is more about the flexible and enthusiastic application of existing tools to spur new investment by lowering the risks and costs of investment with developmental impact. It suggests an approach that uses U.S. government resources and tools to attract, rather than to displace or ignore, private capital, and sees U.S. development agencies as the catalytic minority shareholders in development they have become. \n\nThe Partnership for Growth (PfG) is one of the first direct routes to sustainable development that experiments to operationalize the administration’s Global Development Strategy to bring greater programmatic coherence to U.S. trade and development initiatives in four countries—the Philippines, El Salvador, Ghana, and Tanzania—in Washington and on the ground. ",
      "Key Findings": "This paper argues that PfG began the paradigm shift toward a more coordinated and sustainable development strategy by highlighting the benefits of strategic coordination across agencies at the front end of an initiative. It also brought to light the difficulty of using development resources and tools to attract non-aid actors with what is still basically a government-to-government approach to development. In that sense, PfG is making a significant contribution to a potential agenda for this and future administrations and presents a critical opportunity, regardless of the future of PfG itself. \n\nThe paper points out the challenges of taking PfG to the next level. These challenges include the inability to use authority to strategically align agency program budgets by the National Security Staff (NSS) or Office of Management and Budget (OMB); the inability of a resource-constrained NSS to coordinate multiple agency strategies and budgets around a set of trade and development priorities; and missing incentives within the agencies to combine programs across agencies to greater effect and to engage non-aid actors. Some of these challenges require considerable reorientation, new resources, and the consent of Congress. Other challenges reflect the endemic structural limitations of U.S. trade and development architecture, such as different trade and development agency mandates and jurisdictions and policy restrictions that are vestiges of an era when the private sector was considered best left at arm’s length in U.S. development strategy. If U.S. government priorities are clear—and PfG has demonstrated, it is possible for U.S. development agencies to be on the same strategic page—and if resources are focused where they will have the most sustainable outcomes, with relevant processes and flexible tools, U.S. agencies can maximize opportunities for government agencies and non-aid actors to combine resources to greater developmental effect.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Bringing U.S. government processes, tools, and incentives up to the task of achieving more sustainable development outcomes by going beyond partnerships to attract investment and engage the core business of companies is the next step. \n\n- More aggressive and innovative development finance tools, targeted capacity building, an expanded project development table that includes potential investors, multi-stakeholder approaches, or contributing to corporate platforms where governments are not in the lead, were suggested as possibilities.",

      "Document Summary": "This report captures lessons learned from the field. The report describes Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon (PRRR) as an innovative partnership designed to leverage public and private investments in global health and to build on the successful United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) platform to combat cancers of the breast and cervix in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. By supporting a comprehensive set of country-owned and country-driven interventions, PRRR seeks to reduce deaths from cervical cancer among women screened and treated through the program and to reduce deaths from breast cancer by promoting early detection. The document highlights that PRRR applied a diagonal strategy based on the life course and continuum of care approaches to cancer control. Its work resulted in the delivery of the human papillomavirus vaccine to young girls in several settings and in the strengthening of prevention, screening, and treatment delivery systems from the community to the tertiary level.",
      "Key Findings": "This paper outlines the approach PRRR has taken as a country-aligned public–private partnership and the preliminary lessons learnt, including the need for flexible implementation, effective country coordination mechanism and regular communication with all stakeholders.",
      "Key Recommendations": "•\tA partnership must be flexible and adaptable; there is no single model for all countries to follow in creating the innovative implementation models for global scale-up and use that Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon (PRRR) advocates, and PRRR partners can and must apply the model that each country has identified as best.\n•\tCommunications within and between countries and among PRRR members at the global level must be active, clear and responsive to the needs of any partner and all structures and processes must enable and reward frank, bidirectional communication if problems are to be solved quickly. \n•\tAn efficient country coordination mechanism is essential; communication becomes much clearer and programs move forward much faster if an active technical working group for women’s cancers exists.\n",

      "Document Title": "Pathways of Cooperation: Integrated and Un-integrated International Environmental Governance",
      "Document Summary": "This dissertation argues that governments form integrated cooperation when they share convergent preferences over cooperation. They form unintegrated cooperation when they have divergent preferences. Preferences diverge under one of two conditions: (i) economic actors (“stakeholders”) responsible for the environmental problem operate in diffuse markets, or (ii) states have an asymmetrically interdependent relationship in managing the environmental issue. When neither condition holds, governments share convergent preferences over environmental cooperation. This paper evaluates the importance of stakeholder concentrations, by studying patterns of cooperation on global environmental issues such as climate change, ozone layer depletion, biodiversity loss, and mercury pollution. It evaluates the importance of interdependence structures by studying patterns of cooperation on regional rivers, lakes, and seas.",
      "Key Findings": "In this dissertation, the author explains that when governments have convergent and divergent preferences over international environmental cooperation, one constraint comes from the  individuals, businesses, and communities that generate the environmental problem that prompted international action – the “stakeholders.” When these actors are in concentrated economic markets, governments have more opportunities to economize on international regulation after it begins. Although stakeholders in concentrated economic markets have stronger lobbying power, they make it simpler for governments to create relatively efficient forms of international environmental cooperation. However, when the stakeholders are in diffuse economic markets, governments have less opportunity to economize on international regulation after it begins. They may have ambitious goals at the beginning. The diffuseness of stakeholders makes it infeasible from a political standpoint and impractical from a regulatory standpoint to create international regulation with as much efficiency as when the stakeholders are in concentrated markets. This dissertation documents how un-integrated cooperation reflects obstacles to integrated cooperation. It is a response to obstacles preventing efficient governance. It is a response to divergent political interests. Unintegrated cooperation reflects government efforts to make rules or institutions when barriers to integrated cooperation make that approach infeasible or ineffective. Unintegrated cooperation is the response to divergent preferences. Without efforts to form unintegrated cooperation in the face of political obstacles or governance limitations, the landscape of cooperation would have fewer rules and institutions.\n\nThis dissertation contributes to research on international organization by clarifying when governments make varying forms of international cooperation. In particular, the unintegrated development of international environmental cooperation raises a general puzzle. This dissertation highlights another reason why stakeholders are important in international environmental cooperation, besides their lobbying efforts. Stakeholders can influence the form of environmental cooperation because of the markets in which they operate. Stakeholders operating in concentrated markets enable governments to form integrated regimes; stakeholders operating in diffuse markets force governments to settle for unintegrated regimes.",

      "Document Title": "The UN Global Compact-Accenture CEO Study on Sustainability 2013: Architects of a Better World",
      "Document Summary": "Published by the United Nations Global Compact, the UN Global Compact-Accenture CEO Study on Sustainability 2013, assesses the past, present, and future of sustainable business; discusses a new global architecture to unlock the full potential of business in contributing to global priorities, and reveals how leading companies are adopting innovative strategies to combine impact and value creation. The report argues that business efforts on sustainability may have reached a plateau with a broadened corporate sustainability movement, but many business leaders express doubts about the pace of change and the scale of their impact. Far from continuing to a new peak of achievement, many companies have become stuck on their ascent, unable to scale sustainability at the pace required to address global challenges and achieve business success demanding a global architecture that can enable the business to scale sustainability efforts from an individual, incremental achievement toward new structures and systems that can tap into the evident commitment of business leaders around the world and unlock the full potential of business in contributing to the world’s most pressing challenges. ",
      "Key Findings": "The key findings from this article can be broken down into the following: \n\n• Realism & context understanding the scale of the challenge—and the opportunity.\nThroughout our interviews, it was clear that companies taking the most ambitious action on sustainability were also the most realistic about the scale of the challenge—and are more likely to admit that business is not doing enough. Understanding the challenge also allows these companies to appreciate the opportunity for future growth in providing solutions to sustainability issues and to target strategies to achieve it.\n\n• Growth & differentiation\nTurning sustainability to advantage and value creation. One of the clearest insights from this year’s study is the emergence of a two-speed world in sustainability, between those companies still reacting to external expectations on sustainability and focusing on incremental mitigation, and those that see sustainability through the lens of growth and differentiation. For leading companies, many CEOs told us that the urgency of global challenges provides an opportunity to differentiate their products and services; to access new market segments; and to grow into new regions, countries and areas where their products can meet a pressing need.\n\n• Value & performance\n“What gets measured gets managed.” From carbon emissions to water footprints, tracking environmental measures is now commonplace across industries. Our research suggests that, for companies seeking to go beyond incremental change and tackle global sustainability issues, the challenge is two-fold: not just to measure and manage metrics of reduction and mitigation, but also to quantify the value of sustainability initiatives and more sustainable business models to the company, and to track their impact on the communities in which they operate.",

This report is a synopsis of TB CARE I achievements in Kenya with lessons learned and recommendations.\n\nWhile TB CARE I was successful in maintaining the DLTLD supportive supervision system, it is considered a challenge that the current system is completely dependent on donor funding making it vulnerable to transitional periods and threats of diminishing donor support. It is recommended that DLTLD explores options on how to best address sustainability issues.\n\n\n\n",
      "Key Findings": "Support by TB CARE I for the Division of Leprosy, Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (DLTLD) ensured DLTLD collected data on a regular basis, maintained contact with health facilities, and issues affecting implementation of TB control activities were identified and the necessary decisions were made to maintain quality TB care. Investment to increase participation of all care providers in TB care and control activities led to an increase in national case finding by private facilities.  Kenya significantly strengthened its laboratory sputum-smear External Quality Assurance (EQA) system. Coverage increased from 28% to 88% and error rates declined from 14% to 2.8%. With support from TB CARE I, DLTLD is implementing an innovative web based TB program management system integrated with mobile technology—the first of its kind to be implemented in Africa.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. The DLTLD/CRL should empower the EQA officer to dedicate his time for EQA activities including data analysis and EQA data quality assessment.\n\n2. There is need to establish a specific task force to oversee and coordinate the GeneXpert MTB/Rif implementation and roll out in the country. This team should also coordinate GeneXpert reporting as well as the existing GeneXpert supply management system.\n\n3.  To support the specimen referral system, standard specimen packaging material should be procured and distributed to all the regions in the country.",

      "Document Summary": "Produced for USAID in 2013, “Extending HIV and Broader Health Programming along Transport Corridors within the East African Community” is a practicum report. The report provides information on; i) the prevailing environment for the delivery of HIV and other health services to people living and working along transport corridors within EAC; ii) reviews lessons learned and best practices of partners implementing programming along the corridors, with a focus on identifying opportunities for collaboration; iii) consider key priorities and actions to increase access to services for mobile and resident populations, given current realities; and iv) integrates appropriate actions into strategic plans of transport unions and other actors.\n\nThe practicum report, enriched by the wide array of experienced participants, included presentations, plenary sessions, group discussions, and a gallery walk. The report also provides specific actions identified by the project participants to enhance harmonization, sustainability, and coordination of programming in the region with key findings and recommendations.",
      "Key Findings": "Some of the findings include insufficient access to quality health services for both mobile and host populations; lack of harmonization of health‐related policies, protocols, and guidelines across countries in the region; inadequate coordination between public and private sector actors involved in health service delivery leading to significant duplication of efforts; challenges with the sustainability of externally funded health programming along the transport corridors; gaps in research and a need for better dissemination of program‐relevant information to stakeholders across the region. Based on these findings, the report provides some recommendations to be considered for future undertakings. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The forum recommends the following actions:\n1. Under the leadership of the East African Community (EAC), establish a Multi‐sectoral Task Force to spearhead strategic action for regional integrated health programming along transport corridors (e.g., mapping, policy review, research agenda);\n2. Building on existing national strategies, develop a regional strategy for integrated, comprehensive health programming along the corridors through an inclusive approach with all key stakeholders (e.g., minimum package of services);\n3. Establish an inclusive Regional Advisory and Oversight Forum within EAC with responsibility for coordinating regional integrated health programming along the transport corridors, regional policy formulation, regional program monitoring, capacity building and technical assistance, regional research, knowledge management, etc.\n4. Develop a specific regional strategy for public‐private sector engagement in integrated health programming along transport corridors.",

      "Document Summary": "Produced and published in 2013 at the request of the United States Agency for International Development, this report is an evaluation of the United States Government Central America Regional Partnership Framework. The Central America Partnership Framework (PF) represents a five-year strategic plan to guide efforts in the regional response to the HIV epidemic. It is implemented by the United States Government together with the governments of Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. This report organizes findings, conclusions, and specific recommendations on the four technical areas of the PF, with a focus on sustainability and country ownership. ",
      "Key Findings": "Based on the fieldwork and survey results, overall it is clear USG efforts are widely valued across the region, and continue to fill important resource and technical gaps in national HIV/AIDS strategies. In many cases PEPFAR supported activities can be seen as providing otherwise absent leadership and political support for priority efforts focused on KPs, and have contributed significantly to improving capacity and the policy environment in the region. As one of two major external funding sources for HIV/AIDS programs (PEPFAR and the Global Fund), PEPFAR’s contributions have had a major impact in the region, including strengthening of STI services targeting key populations, and the institutionalization and strengthening of key implementing and decision-making structures such as the National AIDS Councils (NACs) and the ‘Three Ones’, while also providing direct and targeted support to priority program areas. In general, the quality of technical assistance delivered through the four USG agencies and their partners is highly valued within the spheres they work in, but there is a perception of poor coordination and sharing of information across the agencies and with their partners.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Key recommendations include moving towards a vulnerability approach in addition to a risk approach to address the larger barriers such as stigma and discrimination that make key populations vulnerable in the first place. PEPFAR should focus efforts on sustainability for KP prevention and the promotion of public and other funding streams in light of reduced donor funding in the future. To address the challenges of human resources and weak health systems, PEPFAR should increase emphasis on building institutional capacity to ensure improvements made to date are not lost. PEPFAR should support countries to improve capacity for research and continue to strengthen ability to produce and use information through harmonization of systems and indicators.",

      "Document Summary": "This document discusses the evolution of private sector involvement in U.S. foreign assistance programs over recent decades, how globalization has driven the modern approach to development partnerships, the potential benefits, and drawbacks of PPPs, and how partnerships are being used by other bilateral donors and multilateral development agencies. The report then discusses partnership-related issues that may be of interest to Congress as part of the foreign assistance authorization and reform process. \n\nThe report offers the new PPP model, which is designed to take advantage of the growing presence of international corporations, foundations, and other private entities in developing countries through formal relationships marked by common objectives, mutual resource contributions, and shared risk. The report outlines the potential benefits of PPPs. ",
      "Key Findings": "Through this new model, development agencies are able to overcome technical, legal, and financial barriers to accessing certain technology and will be able to extend their global reach into more developing countries. Partnering with a U.S. government entity can lend legitimacy to a private entity and the association with development activities can enhance a corporation’s reputation for being socially responsible.\n\nWhile many development experts see PPPs as having the potential to be mutually beneficial, some are also wary of unbalanced partnership relationships and the resource demands of partnership management leading to a number of potentially negative impacts. Among the most often-cited concerns, this report provides some of those concerns which include; Management Burdens and Inadequate Evidence of Value Added, Distortion of Development Priorities, Disadvantages to Least-Developed Countries and Individuals, Unfair Advantage to Private Partners, Bad Bedfellows, and Threat to American Jobs. The report highlights on the issues for Congress as well which include; Cost Savings, International Commitments, Emphasis on Non-aid Development Strategies, Budget and Procurement Issues, and Interagency Leadership. Finally, the report sheds light on the potential challenges to congressional control and oversight of development activities, as Congress does not have the same control over private funds as it does over appropriated funds. Such concerns are largely hypothetical, but they raise the issue of how Congress can best manage public resources involved in PPPs.",

      "Key Findings": "This paper utilizes qualitative, exploratory data, obtained via multiple research methods, to investigate the CSR practices of major pharmaceutical companies in the UK and Germany. The data are employed to critically re-examine and revise a previously published explanatory framework which identifies the management steps involved in CSR stakeholder engagement. The resulting revised explanatory framework is the main contribution of this paper. By abstracting those factors which influence CSR practice, it provides an analytical\ntool which is designed to be of practical use for business decision-makers when managing their stakeholder engagement activities. Given that the research addresses values and ideals and prescribes practical recommendations for practitioners, it is essentially applied and normative in nature. Ultimately, the framework proposes a set of steps for developing CSR strategies which could help CSR professionals to make a ‘mindset transition’ from a narrower ‘traditional’ approach to CSR to a more innovative way of thinking.\n",

      "Document Title": "External Evaluation of Saving Mothers, Giving Life ",
      "Document Summary": "Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL) seeks to reduce maternal mortality through a public-private partnership between the governments of the United States, Norway, Uganda, and Zambia and organizations such as Merck for Mothers, Every Mother Counts, the American College of Gynecology and Obstetrics, and Project CURE. It encompasses a wide scope of activities that fall into four categories: generating demand, improving access, improving quality, and strengthening health systems. \nResearch was carried out by independent researchers at Columbia University and New York University, this report assesses the reach, extent, fidelity, and dynamic effects of SMGL in order to identify best practices and remaining barriers to reducing maternal mortality in Uganda and Zambia and to inform future efforts of SMGL. It also examines the functioning of the SMGL partnership and the engagement of various stakeholders. This report covers SMGL’s Phase 1, the first 12-18 months of SMGL implementation. ",
      "Key Findings": "The article suggets that they found that a large number of activities were carried out within the first year of SMGL and SMGL was generally well received by women in communities, although there was anxiety about continuation of the program after the end of year 1. In both Uganda and Zambia, providers in SMGL districts scored modestly better than their counterparts in comparison districts on a test of obstetric knowledge. The majority of implementers, national stakeholders, and community respondents felt that SMGL was instrumental in raising awareness of maternal mortality in the focus districts. In general, SMGL’s global leaders agreed that the SMGL partnership was greater than the sum of its parts because it leveraged more resources and garnered creative new ideas for action on maternal health from a broad and non-traditional group of constituents. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Commit to five years—with a clear transition plan\n2. Think in terms of health system packages and not isolated interventions\n3. Training is not enough—consider other cost-effective models for improving care quality\n4. Focus on \"last mile\" women\n5. Clarify the SMGL governance structure—globally and in host countries\n6. Test future intervention packages using rigorous evaluation methods",

      "Document Title": "Impact Investing 2.0: The Way Forward -- Insight from 12 Outstanding Funds",
      "Document Summary": "This document lays out the foundation for supplanting the guesswork and conjecturing in impact investing with solid evidence of high performance and, in the process, exposes the concrete practices of outstanding funds for use as the foundation for a more sophisticated and successful market. It explores the funds that had proven successful in generating impact to their key stakeholders, regardless of geography, asset class, and blended return objective. It attempts to understand, in each case, what factors led to a fund’s success. In conjunction with this report, 12 fund case studies were published online. Each case study provides thorough context for the notion of performance, by impact investing funds as well as insight into world-class learning organizations that have course corrected carefully throughout their lifespan. Taken together, the case studies disclose a magnitude of private impact investing fund data never shared publicly. The data in this report reveals a cross-section of high-performing impact investment funds and a set of shared attributes that are unique to this generation of fund creation, management, and harvest.",
      "Key Findings": "The findings from the study can broadly be divided into four: \n\n• Policy Symbiosis\nDespite much of the “limited government” rhetoric found in some impact investing discussions, government has been a critical player in both financing the field and creating a supportive regulatory environment within which the best funds prosper.\n\n• Catalytic Capital\nThe most successful impact investing funds understand the role of Catalytic Capital as critical not only for financial, but also strategic reasons.\n\n• Multilingual Leadership \nThere is an evolving myth that financial skills alone are the key to successful impact investing, but our research shows that impact funds managed by those with financial discipline combined with skills from the public, non-profit, and related sectors (e.g. development finance) were best positioned both to generate financial returns and create social/environmental value.\n\n• Mission First and Last\nIn the 1.0 era, impact investors were encouraged to present themselves as being either “Financial-first” or “Impact-First.” ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Given, then, that impact investing will continue to grow and evolve, what are the fundamental questions we should consider in years to come? We start with this initial set:\n■ Which of these four trends will still be true 10 or 20 years from now?\n■ What percentage of the market will remain closely tied to policy and Catalytic Capital? Will the responsibility of institutional alignment come to be seen as commonplace in a holistic approach to capital market development and operations?\n■ Will Multilingual Leadership get easier as more talent enters the field? Or will the field become more specialized and the experience sets more distinct?",

      "Document Summary": "This paper reviews Nigeria's PPP practices and institutional frameworks. It compares them with selected global best-practice countries and suggests how PPP can become self-sustaining. Among other recommendations, the paper calls for mainstreaming of PPP through an institutional restructuring process that creates a cocktail of full-service PPP agencies, vested with both regulatory and executive powers as is the case in many global best practice countries. However, success with the proposed framework calls for more holistic PPP legislation, sustainable long-term financing models, and a comprehensive business dispute resolution framework.",
      "Key Findings": "Arising from the review of selected best practices, demand-driven, transcendence, long-term horizon, financial independence, and core structural integrity are considered to be the five pillars of sound PPP institutions.",
      "Key Recommendations": "•\tDecentralization of PPP planning, authorization, and implementation: A diffused PPP approval and engagement mechanism is necessary for mainstreaming PPP and ensuring value-for-money in capital budget implementation. Decentralized and simplified approval processes can speed up mainstreaming of PPP.\n•\tNecessity of specialized agencies for critical infrastructures: It is needful to have specialized PPP agencies for key infrastructures like highways, petroleum exploration and refining, gas pipelines, rail systems, ICT broadcasting, electricity, and so on.\n•\tImportance of Central full-scale PPP Agencies: Central PPP agencies equipped with strong capacities for regulation, planning, implementation, facilitation, and market development would make PPP execution and regulation more effective and efficient.\n•\tMDAs and the LGCs use PPP to support capital budget implementation: Fiscal Strategy Papers (FSPs) of government should encourage MDAs and the LGCs to finance/implement an increasing percentage of their capital budget through PPPs to instill fiscal discipline and the culture of cost recovery.\n•\tCreating a comprehensive dispute resolution mechanism: An unbiased and responsive dispute resolution mechanism, with dedicated courts for business disputes, would reduce sundry risks and render the business environment more investor friendly.\n•\tInevitability of a sustainable long-term financing model: A sustainable long term financing mechanism is critical for success of PPPs. It is quite inappropriate to finance infrastructure projects having long term payback period with loans from MDBs.",

      "Document Summary": "Produced and published at the request of the United States Agency for International Development in December 2013, this report assesses the effectiveness of the 2007–13 USAID/DELIVER project in Malawi. It identifies strengths, weaknesses, and lessons learned. It also draws conclusions about the most significant achievements of the project in terms of the objectives of USAID/Malawi and the Government of Malawi for supply chain reinforcement and commodity security (CS). As a secondary objective of the evaluation, it assesses the gaps in supply chain management (SCM) in terms of the project’s current program and approach and identifies potential future programming approaches.",
      "Key Findings": "Though the performance of the project has been mixed, USAID/DELIVER has successfully operated PSCs and made procurement on behalf of the United States Government (USG) and has institutionalized a logistics management information system (LMIS) in Malawi. The influence of USAID/DELIVER lies in its ability to pursue long-term goals and encourage Malawi government ownership of some or most of the activities. Since USAID mandated one-year plans for 2012 and 2013, the approach has changed to a short-term vision and strategy, which has not benefited the project.\n\nSome activities in the work plan were not begun; others were carried out beyond their target, such as \"number of  unannounced spot checks conducted at third party warehousing and transport operations\". Data produced by the outdated LMIS system are not secure or validated; to be used at the central level, they must be thoroughly cleaned. The whole USAID/DELIVER management and reporting structure merits thorough USAID review to ensure that for the rest of the contract period the project complies with standard reporting procedures and that meaningful indicators of progress (output, outcome and impact) are linked to objectives and set reporting formats to track quarterly progress  for all indicators.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations:\n\nUSAID should consider:\n1. Reinstating multiyear strategies, work plans, and performance frameworks.\n2. Including cost-effectiveness parameters and value for money in future SCM contracts.\n3. Performance-based financing that directly links a portion of the funding to results.\n4. Promoting discussion within the health donor community about how to strengthen plans for the future “integrated” supply chain and potential support to CMST during the transition period.\n5. Shifting verification of self-reported data to external organizations that can conduct rigorous representative evaluations for annual performance reviews, LMIS, and assessment of national storage systems.\n\nFor its part, the USAID/DELIVER Project should consider:\n1. Identifying meaningful indicators to track SCM performance and draft PMPs with indicators linked to objectives and to outcomes, outputs, and impact over the strategy period.\n\n2. Drawing up, with USAID approval, multiyear country strategies and work plans, with HTSS-P inputs from the outset.\n\n3. Improving quarterly report quality by reporting activities and indicators consistently.\n\n4. Working across other commodity groups, such as essential drugs, and collecting data for quantification.\n\n5. Resolving data inaccuracies between reports.\n\n6. Facilitating selection of the e-LMIS by MOH and CMST, the eventual system users.\n\n7. Reviewing the costing structure of PSC and other SCM services and ensuring accountability and transparency.\n\n8. Whether the project will have a role during the transition to the integrated national supply chain.\n\n9. Heightening support for capacity-building support in such cross-cutting areas as governance and leadership.",

      "Document Summary": "This report explores key challenges of the Okavango Basin, identifies specific areas vulnerable to climate change, and discusses vulnerabilities of different livelihoods. Finally, the report outlines existing and needed capacity at the local, national, and regional levels in the custodian Basin countries of Angola, Namibia, and Botswana. \n\nThe report highlights that the direction of change in biophysical impacts remains uncertain and dependent on the direction of change in rainfall and river discharge. The climate change projections - the exposure component of vulnerability to climate change signaled increasing temperatures, yet sent a more complicated message regarding rainfall and river discharge. While rainfall changes might be spatially different, there was a slight indication toward overall drier conditions in the Basin, despite possible increases in rainfall in some areas. This implies that while the conditions in the Okavango River Basin might be drier in the future, there could still be an increase in rainfall and flooding in some areas. Additionally, this may indicate that overall conditions in the Basin could be wetter in the future.",
      "Key Findings": "The report found all livelihood strategies including tourism, commercial farming, communal farming, and natural resource harvesting except mining, to be sensitive to the possible socioeconomic impacts of climate change under various scenarios. The identified socioeconomic impacts showed communal farming as the livelihood with the greatest sensitivity to climate change, reflecting the close linkage of communal farming and biophysical elements. While the direction of change and the magnitude of biophysical impacts are difficult to project, the socioeconomic impacts identified were more generic with possible socioeconomic impacts reflecting the sensitivities of specific livelihood strategies in the Basin. Mining was seen as having the necessary financial means to buffer possible impacts, while the tourism sector is likely to face mostly secondary consequences that impact operational costs and the degree to which the sector can attract tourists. But socioeconomic impacts identified reflected how climate change has the potential to push communal farmers across a threshold to very insecure and stressed livelihood conditions. \n\nThe report shows some capacity within Basin countries at all levels. Some relevant Basin policies are in place; however, implementation is sometimes not effective. At the local government level, the components highlighted included the presence of institutions and the existence of local plans, policies, and structures, coupled with well-organized frameworks for disaster response. At the national government level, there was also a focus on the existence of frameworks, policies, and programs, with somewhat different aspects being emphasized across the three countries. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "- In summary, the assessment established that sustainable management of the Okavango Basin should be a key priority to ensure a sound and functioning ecosystem that supports sustainable livelihoods and is resilient to climate variability and change.\n\n- While the system has a considerable degree of resilience, the increased pressures and challenges for the ecosystem, such as increased development, mining, irrigation schemes, and veterinary fencing, require a coordinated approach. With resilience maintained over time, the Okavango River Basin will be in a better position to cope with and absorb some level of climate variability and change.\n\n- While a coordinated Basin-wide response is important, it is also crucial to support further capacity development on the national and local levels to prepare for and respond to more unpredictable weather patterns that may affect natural and socioeconomic systems. \n",

      "Document Title": "Capital's New Frontier: From \"Unusable\" Economies to Bottom-of-the-Pyramid Markets in Africa",
      "Document Summary": "This article argues that certain initiatives create “bottom of the pyramid” (BoP) economies through a set of market technologies, practices, and discourses that render the spaces and actors at the bottom of the pyramid knowable, calculable, and predictable to global business. The article describes how these technologies extend new forms of market governance over the informal poor, reconfiguring their habits, social practices, and economic strategies under the banner of poverty reduction. \n",
      "Key Findings": "The paper highlights that the BoP model posits a natural alignment between business goals of profit maximization and development aspirations for poverty reduction, and it has been much celebrated in academic and policy circles. Yet while the BoP approach is championed as a new tool of “inclusive” global development, its embrace raises critical questions about how and to what effect the under-utilized poor are assimilated into the ambit of global markets. This article suggests, rather, that business creates BoP economies through a set of market technologies, practices, and discourses that render the spaces and actors at the bottom of the pyramid knowable, calculable, and predictable to global business. In contrast to prevailing analyses of the BoP, which focus on the economic benefits (e.g., access to capital, income) accrued by firms and beneficiaries, the article examines how business constitutes and develops the BoP, making the unknown frontier of “unusable” Africa into a viable market for global capital.\n\nDrawing on primary and secondary research on BoP schemes in Africa, it explores how management practices, concepts, and technologies bring those who are decoupled from “productive” economic activity into the circuits of inclusive capitalism. Building on the work of anthropologists who have examined the organizational and knowledge practices that underscore the making of development interventions, the article identifies and analyzes four processes through which business brings Africa’s informal economies into the fold of BoP initiatives: (1) the identification of a development/market problem; (2) legitimacy building through external sources of expertise; (3) the specification of proposed beneficiaries (e.g., underserved consumers and underemployed entrepreneurs) through market research; and (4) the creation of beneficiaries—consumers and entrepreneurs—through market education and a range of calculative devices.

      "Document Title": "Asean Rate: The Asean Regional Agricultural Trade Environment Assessment",
      "Document Summary": "Launched in April 2012, this RATE assessment report covers the ten member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to examine a range of agriculture and trade-related policies, laws, institutions, and social dynamics that impact the environment for trade both with respect to international markets and among the ASEAN Member States themselves.  The RATE methodology is drawn from USAID’s well-established Agribusiness Climate Legal and Institutional Reform (AgCLIR) diagnostic tool, a comprehensive approach to examining many country-specific aspects of starting and running an agribusiness, including farming, processing, exporting, and other agriculture-related enterprises. RATE has been adapted from AgCLIR as an efficient – but still detailed–method for examining regional legal and institutional environments for trading in agricultural goods. \n\nDrawing qualitative and quantitative information across each ASEAN Member State, RATE identifies specific policies and practices on a comparative basis, highlighting how certain efforts at legal and regulatory harmonization or strengthened institutional performance can improve conditions for food security and growth. Mindful of comprehensive efforts to bring together ASEAN’s Member States as one economic, political, and socio-economic community by 2015 the RATE assessment has devoted special attention to opportunities for legal harmonization and institutional collaboration across the region. In addition to summarizing the state of key laws and institutions involved with agricultural trade within ASEAN’s Member states, RATE proposes a number of opportunities for action that can be considered, by various stakeholders for integration and consideration. ",
      "Key Findings": "Critically, the RATE Opportunities for Action are grounded in an awareness there are many pathways to change. Within the ASEAN region, important reforms can be moved forward by a single, visionary champion or a by groundswell of stakeholders. In most cases, a “big idea” —including the type that is often promoted by regional or international organizations such as ASEAN, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the World Economic Forum, and others—can be broken down into many smaller tasks, which, again, can be seized by a variety of public and private actors. Accordingly, the Opportunities for Action found in the topic reports are intended to be multifaceted. Against a backdrop of dramatic change across ASEAN in recent years, the RATE deliverables are intended to serve as useful inputs to an environment of informed and inclusive long-term growth.",

      "Document Summary": "This is a report on the mid-term evaluation of the Institutional Support and Strengthening Program (ISSP) funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission in Jordan. It summarizes the results achieved; identifies lessons learned and what factors contributed the most to success and failure; assesses the strengths and weaknesses of program management and administration, and approaches and methods used in engagement with the Government of Jordan (GOJ); and provides recommendations to USAID on how best to improve the impact, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness of similar projects in the future.",
      "Key Findings": "Key findings of the evaluation show that the ISSP provided a vision and implementation plan to achieve sector reform and was well received by the sector stakeholders. This vision and implementation plan for the sector addressed the core restructuring and reform activities, such as: the need for legal reforms; the creation of new bodies; the separation of regulation and planning from bulk water delivery and retention; further corporatization of utilities, and transfer of authorities such as licensing of wells. However, the implementation of the core reform agenda has been stalled by political factors and resulting in changes in leadership positions within the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI). Despite this, ISSP has been able to make progress on many other fronts, due to the flexibility inherent in the program, and the competent execution by ISSP management. As a result, ISSP has been able to continually re-assess the situation on the ground and adjust its implementation tasks accordingly. ISSP has been commended for its professionalism, its quality reports and outputs, and its openness and collaborative approach.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- The ISSP program has moved the process forward but follow-up is needed to see it through. A more focused program based on the core reform agenda is required for the future, with clear steps and commitments from GOJ before proceeding to the next step.\n- Given that ISSP is not intended as the vehicle to fully implement the reform agenda for the water sector, by way of an exit strategy, ISSP should undertake a detailed forecast/assessment of the resources required to see the reforms through to practical completion, and recommend modalities for how this can be accomplished.\n- ISSP, and USAID, will need to continue to find effective ways to exert influence at the political level.\n- ISSP should explore the benefits (to both sides) of establishing a stronger working relationship with the GiZ Water Program at the Ministry, including co-financing opportunities and the synergies that would result.",

      "Document Summary": "Feed the Future in Ethiopia summarizes the strategies that the project used while implementing the project and highlights the results and key achievements. Through Feed the Future Project, the United States is supporting Ethiopia's own priorities for agriculture-based economic growth by strengthening strategic crops, agricultural commodities, and livestock value chains, promoting private sector engagement, increasing access to credit, targeting relevant research and development efforts for inputs such as seeds and fertilizers, and improving market access. ",
      "Key Findings": "Feed the Future's work in Ethiopia in FY2014 accounts for fact that more than 217,600 farmers and other producers applied new technologies and practices for the first time with Feed the Future's help. Producers also applied improved technologies and management practices on more than 90,800 hectares of land with Feed the Future's help. Feed the Future-supported farmers and producers increased the value of their agricultural product sales by more than $45.6 million while Feed the Future leveraged more than $27.49 million in new private investment in food and agriculture in Ethiopia. The U.S. Government programs reached more than 1.3 million children under 5 across Ethiopia to improve their nutrition.\n\nEthiopia, supported by Feed the Future and private sector partners, introduced the first locally-fortified wheat flour in the country while the program also helped Ethiopia establish its first blended fertilizer production facility and the first camel milk processing center, with demand for additional centers. USAID's Food for Peace environmental rehabilitation activities also restored more than 20,000 hectares of land, which will improve households' resilience to the effects and pressure of climate change. Ethiopia experienced a 40 percent increase in the value of livestock in pastoral dryland areas targeted by Feed the Future livestock value chain programs and partners helped facilitate more than $10 million in private sector investment into pastoralist dryland areas targeted by livestock value chain and other Feed the Future supported programs.",

      "Document Summary": "This document is a project completion report outlining the details of achievements against the set target goals and objectives in ROADS II, the follow-on to the successful Regional Outreach Addressing AIDS through Development Strategies (ROADS I). The report confirms that the project largely met or exceeded its targets across the program areas and interventions, for both the mobile populations it has served and the interacting local community members adding new interventions to its original programmatic purview. This means it extends the range of health and development services provided, which includes gender-based violence (GBV) prevention, alcohol abuse counseling and support groups, nutritional support to families and individuals through the innovative design and training provision of community gardens and bio-intensive gardens. The project provided economic strengthening through the creation, training, and support of local Group Savings and Loan Associations (GSLAs), a key development model that strengthens the economic resilience of communities, families, and individuals, with savings enabling greater access to health services. The report highlights the \"Cluster Model\" as a key innovation that contributed to an improved quality of life of the cluster members individually and at an organizational level. ",
      "Key Findings": "With this case study, we can understand that at the community level, there is great untapped interest in participating in health and development programming and in developing appropriate skills.\nIn addition, in under-served corridor communities, educational and literacy levels are generally low, requiring the development of appropriate tools and materials. Initial community expectation often revolves around ‘hand-outs’; this learning process is continual and requires sensitivity in initial mobilization and sensitization activities. Economic Strengthening programming requires careful planning with other programming components so as to provide consistent messages about expectations from the project. And it is clear that households frequently need ongoing support rather than one-off activities to change behaviors.\n\nRegarding the FP/RH and GBV Program, the study points out that conducting baseline assessments on KAP in the community and facilities prior to program design is critical in addressing/targeting gaps identified thus contributing to effective systems strengthening and use of resources. Recruitment and deployment of dedicated FP/RH Technical Officers ensure effective and efficient implementation of activities and collaboration with partners, MoH, CBOS, NGOs, etc.  Availability of basic or adequate equipment, materials and supplies at facilities increases the use and quality of services (feedback from MoH in participating countries).\n\nIn terms of alcohol/substance abuse, the study found that due to the profile of ROADS II sites, brewing and selling local alcohol is a thriving business, and therefore to make ends meet, many low-income women are involved in this business. To address this, project beneficiaries were encouraged to get involved in ROADS II economic strengthening activities which provide three levels of livelihood support; 1) mobilizing financial safety nets through savings (GSLA); 2) maximizing household production; and 3) increasing market readiness. Lastly, facilitating platforms for disparate audiences to meet and discuss difficult, even taboo subjects in a neutral environment can initiate a process of constructive engagement and joint activity, such as bringing together police and female sex workers to discuss issues around GBV. However, building trust for sensitive community dialogue can be time-consuming and requires skilled facilitators.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations\nCross-cutting\n1. There is a need to improve the acquisition and distribution of IEC materials because this plays a significant role in educating and influencing behavior change among the mobile populations.\n2. There is high demand for Alcohol/GBV risk prevention interventions in the community following the mobilization and formation of Community Alcohol Support Groups and task forces. Formation of these groups should therefore be replicated in other ROADS sites and countries.\n\nFP/RH and MNCH\n1. Urgent need to conduct training for FP providers in public and private sectors in sites where FP/RH adoption is slow. This includes the drug shop owners and health care providers in the government-owned health units. There are glaring gaps in the knowledge levels of the providers, especially in the mid and long-term contraceptive methods.\n2. There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure of health facilities in some sites/countries to improve privacy while conducting FP/GBV services.\n\nEconomic Strengthening\n1. ES programmes should specifically target households with orphans or adopted children living within, as an indicator of vulnerable households, and link any ES intervention to child-level outcomes. OVC household populations could be targeted for sensitization on Economic Strengthening interventions, and then allow self-selection into the intervention by individual households.\n2. GSLA alone cannot be hailed as the single financial service acting as a change agent in the household economy but as a critical starting point for the use of more formal financial services. Whilst accepting the value respondents see in pulling on GSLA resources as a response to seasonal shocks, programs should continue to encourage the use of these resources for productive, more than for consumption uses for loans thereby derived.",

      "Document Summary": "This case study aims to document the 4e Camino al Progreso (4e) program as a new and evolving model and to identify early lessons for SABMiller, MIF, and FUNDES as well as other companies, civil society organizations, donors, and governments interested in empowering small businesses within corporate value chains. While 4e focuses on small retailers, many insights from experience may be equally applicable to programs focused on other small businesses, such as small farmers, other suppliers, and distributors. The case study highlights the importance of empowering individual entrepreneurs and at the same time strengthening the broader business ecosystems in which they operate. The study also highlights the potential for sustainability and scale of the impact associated with embedding such programs within core business operations and at the same time leveraging strategic external partnerships.",
      "Key Findings": "There is a need to empower entrepreneurs as individuals and invest in the whole person: entrepreneur, head of household, community reference point and potential leader. We need to understand and work within the entrepreneurs’ incentive structures, leverage relationships of trust, facilitate experiential learning and find an appropriate balance between reach and impact. To strengthen broader business ecosystems, prioritize challenges to address, understand stakeholder incentives and institutional capacity, seek the support of catalysts where necessary to unlock action. Finally,  integration with core business operations requires a effort to create measurable value for the business and for society, cultivate country-level ownership with corporate level leadership and support, provide flexibility for countries to customize and build upon the common core program.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Companies can:\n1. Focus on small businesses that are already part of their value chains or have the potential to become part. \n2. Combine core business operations and corporate social investment.\n3. Identify and enlist champions across the organization.\n4. Set clear objectives both for the number of small businesses to be reached and for the impact to be achieved.\n5. Evaluate the business case, calculating financial returns on investment wherever possible in addition to capturing other non-financial benefits.\n6. Concentrate on understanding and measuring\ndevelopment impact.\n7. Prioritize opportunities to partner.\n\nPublic and private donors can:\n1. Invest in strengthening the capacity of small business support service providers\n2. Catalyze programs with potential for sustainability and scale.\n3. Fund experimentation with technology-based delivery of small business support services.\n4. Advocate with governments.\n5. Use convening power to help bring additional partners to the table, where useful to expand a program’s reach and impact - directly and through demonstration effects.\n\nGovernments can:\n1. Strengthen the enabling environment for small businesses through policies and programs.\n2. Ensure that publicly-funded small business support services respond to market needs.\n3. Engage with large domestic and foreign companies to explore opportunities for collaboration to strengthen small businesses and capitalize on existing and potential value chain linkages.",

      "Document Title": "Livestock Emergency Guidelines and Standards (LEGS) ",
      "Key Findings": "The LEGS process grew out of the recognition that livestock are a crucial livelihood asset for people throughout the world – many of whom are poor and vulnerable to both natural and human-induced disasters – and that livestock support is an important component of emergency aid programmes. Taking a livelihoods perspective in emergency response highlights the need to develop close links between relief and development; for example, through emergency preparedness and post-emergency rehabilitation. Some donors and NGOs are moving towards more holistic programming, and new approaches are evolving. Examples are large-scale social protection systems for pastoralists, and insurance schemes to protect farmers and livestock keepers from weather hazards. By harmonizing relief and development programming, development professionals can help their clients become more resilient to disasters. LEGS’s key focus is to improve the quality of humanitarian interventions. However, the vulnerability of livestock keepers to disaster is determined by a range of socio-economic, political, environmental, and demographic factors, and humanitarian work cannot ignore these issues nor the need to link itself with development and with long-term policy changes to reduce vulnerability. Humanitarian work must also take account of the future possible impacts of climate change on livestock keepers, including increased risks of disasters.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Key guidance notes from the LEGS include: \n\n1. Preventive veterinary care: Prior to distribution, animals should be vaccinated, dewormed, and receive other preventive animal health care depending on the local disease situation. In most cases this service is provided as a single input, free of charge.\n\n2. Long-term veterinary care: Beneficiary communities should have continued access to animal health-care services, both preventive and curative, according to the standards and guidelines set out in Chapter 5 (Veterinary support). A system for continuing care should be established at the time the livestock are distributed to ensure they receive the treatment they need. This long-term care system may also provide an opportunity to collect monitoring and evaluation data.\n\n3. Training and capacity building: Communities targeted for replacing livelihood-generating livestock or else providing livestock as a new livelihood activity may have limited husbandry knowledge, or the knowledge may have been lost if the emergency has endured over a long period. In such cases, the provision of livestock should be accompanied by adequate capacity building in the care and management of the animals in order to ensure that the stock survive, are well cared for, and can provide a useful contribution to post-emergency livelihoods. Training and/or providing information on the market economy may also be useful to secure livestock-based livelihoods in the longer term.\n\n4. Preparedness for future emergencies: In communities without\nsignificant livestock management experience, it is important to develop preparedness skills to minimize the risk of losing animals in future events.\n\n5. Food security support: The food security needs of beneficiary households should be assessed, and additional support provided until the livestock become fully productive.\n\n6. Shelter and non-food support: Families receiving livestock may require shelter, basic household utensils, bedding, water containers, and livestock-related equipment such as carts, harnesses, and ploughs. Without this support, they may be forced to sell livestock. The use of cash or voucher mechanisms may also be considered for this support.\n\n7. Withdrawal of food security support: Recipients should receive food security assistance until livestock and/or other livelihood activities can provide enough support. This avoids early and non-sustainable offtake of livestock. A well-designed participatory monitoring system can include measures of herd growth and other livelihood-based indicators to determine the best time to withdraw food aid.",

This will create an innovative alternative that benefits all key stakeholders involved in natural resource management efforts.",
      "Key Findings": "Expected outcomes of pilot PES implementation: Pilot PES implementation in MSKM-MAB is expected to establish a system of PES innovation by incorporating engagement with local communities, the private sector and government to develop a transparent pilot payment scheme that ensures equality in benefit sharing from ecosystem services such as watershed regulation, aesthetic and recreation, and carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change, to both providers and beneficiaries.\n\nLocal communities are expected to gain livelihood benefits from payment allocation or support activities identified in the pilot scheme. Lessons learned and policy recommendations will enable a legal framework to support long term implementation. Scaling up of PES innovation will also benefit other countries in Southeast Asia, such as Laos, through study tour exchanges and sharing lessons learned via the regional platform.",

      "Key Findings": "Mutual benefits, favorable organizational culture and preparedness and early action all facilitated private sector and humanitarian engagement in Haiti. Cash transfer programming proved fertile ground for collaboration because banks and mobile phone companies had commercial incentives to facilitate payments and aid agencies needed safe, accountable and wide-reaching cash and voucher distribution channels. Recent experience in Haiti shows that humanitarian and private sector engagement offers the potential for increasing financial resources, accessing technical capacity, and supporting the local economy. Relations between humanitarian agencies and businesses in Haiti are surrounded by a cloud of mistrust. There are some valid reasons for this– imported goods, distributions, and free services by aid agencies have damaged local businesses, and the private sector is poorly regulated with a small number of very powerful players.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Practical opportunities for furthering humanitarian and private sector engagement in Haiti include:\n\n• Support disaster preparedness and response measures with mobile network operators, with a view to promoting a more effective and coordinated approach to using mobile platforms in disaster response.\n\n• Increase cash-based responses and work with the government, financial service providers, mobile phone companies and aid agencies to develop a\ncontingency plan for providing cash transfers at scale in future disaster responses.\n\n• Promote local procurement by aid agencies and facilitate the inclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n• Consider identifying/establishing platforms for humanitarian and private sector engagement, in order to share lessons and experiences and to\nidentify opportunities for collaboration.\n\n• Support disaster preparedness initiatives and education in private schools.\n\n• Adopt a ‘do no harm’ approach to the impact of humanitarian interventions on the local economy, supporting the local economy to the extent possible and recognising and minimising negative impacts.\n\n• Undertake research on the impact of humanitarian and private sector engagement on the effectiveness and efficiency of humanitarian response.",

      "Key Findings": "Looking ahead, if Kenya is to cut dependence on food assistance and reduce and manage its own humanitarian crises, a number of changes are needed, including a more prominent role for the private sector in preparedness and response. Taking greater national responsibility for humanitarian challenges will require a capacity to raise more resources domestically or through borrowing internationally; an improved transport system that allows the private sector to deliver relief items rapidly; more integrated and resilient markets in drought-prone areas; a capacity to transfer cash to crisis-affected people so that they can make use of those markets; a middle class educated on humanitarian issues and willing to contribute and hold their government to account; and a government that plans with the private and NGO sectors, taking advice on international best practice. Some of these points feature in the EDES. Overall, Kenya is making good progress in some areas, but there are uncertainties in others, particularly over the role of the government.",
      "Key Recommendations": "If Kenya is to take greater responsibility for managing larger humanitarian crises, it will be crucial to encourage markets to function during droughts and to explore new ways to transfer resources to people made vulnerable by crises. Donors are supporting a wide range of experiments in these areas, and these should continue, coordinated by the government in close cooperation with the private sector and international donors. More broadly, significant new investment in the ASALs (e.g. by foreign oil companies), and new water and transport links) means that humanitarian actors will need to engage large private sector investors to sensitise them to humanitarian issues and build the relationships that will be needed in a crisis. Large agencies such as the World Food Programme should engage more closely with transport planners to ensure that their concerns are taken into account as new infrastructure is planned. As transport efficiency improves there will be more opportunities for the purchase of humanitarian supplies in the region. This merits separate study.",

This report highlights the evaluation team’s findings and recommendations. ",
      "Key Findings": "The report highlights that the UCP Program is an ambitious venture that effectively increased national and district HRH policy and planning capacity and galvanized a wide range of stakeholders from the public and private sectors and the donor community to collaborate in rolling out new HRH systems and policies nationally. Together, UCP and MOH mounted outstanding advocacy and lobbying effort to address a well-documented shortage of health workers in the country, resulting in the allocation of substantial funding to recruit and deploy more than 7,000 health workers across the country, and contributing considerably to reducing national health worker shortages. Some central-level managers and district-level units lack the necessary capacity to use and sustain the HRIS system for planning, decision making, and reporting due to structural and motivational issues. Performance management fits well within the UCP’s HRH strategic focus and was an identified priority by stakeholders. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "At the Technical Level (USAID and UCP)\n- Review, reduce and rationalize the intervention mix to focus on those most essential to reinforce the capacity of MOH and districts to lead, prioritize, monitor, and be accountable for national HRH functions.\n- Expand use of the extensive HRIS data to advance workforce analyses and projections to include but not be limited to analysis of disaggregated data to advance health workforce planning.\n\nAt the Policy Level (USAID and GOU)\n- Enhance engagement of multiple stakeholders, and create strategic alliances, including public-private partnerships with non-traditional partners such as businesses and electrical and Internet companies to strengthen the sustainability of HRIS.\n- Reinvigorate stakeholder ownership to review, strengthen, and upgrade pre-service nursing and midwifery education to ensure that the country produces the number and quality of nurses and midwives needed to meet national health priorities, especially reduced maternal mortality.\n- Negotiate a plan between GOU, multilateral stakeholders, and the private sector to continue to strengthen HRH policy, planning, systems development, and continuity with clearly defined activities and dates for a full handover of all functions to the government, and explore opportunities to setting up a public-private venture for establishing a National Health Leadership, Management and Professional Development Institute.\n",

      "Document Title": "The Roles of Non-State Actors in Climate Change Governance: Understanding Agency Through Governance Proﬁles",
      "Document Summary": "This paper examines the non-state actors involved in global climate governance focusing mainly on whether and how non-state actors can influence states. Using unique survey material from two climate change conferences, this paper proposes that different categories of non-state actors have distinct governance profiles. It further suggests that the different governance profiles are derived from particular power sources and that agency is a function of these profiles. The study thereby contributes to a strand in the literature focusing on the authority of non-state actors in climate governance and broadens the methodological toolkit for studying the ‘‘governors’’ of global governance.",
      "Key Findings": "The findings on the governance profiles show that certain activities are strongly associated with one particular non-state actor category, such as raising awareness (ENGOs 73 %), providing expertise (RINGOs 67 %), and representing marginalized voices (IPO 60 %). The results also show that no single category of non-state actors is strong across all governance activities. This indicates that there is room for cooperation across the categories to achieve greater impact across the policy spectrum. The trend toward partnerships in climate governance may reflect this insight. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The paper also has implications for the future research agenda. While the questionnaire methodology provides a means to map perceptions of roles, more qualitative methods are likely to be needed to examine the link between power sources, governance profiles, and agency more closely, and to move beyond aggregate categories of governance activities in order to provide more fine-tuned insights on agency in particular contexts. Future studies can build on the results presented in this paper to explore what different governance activities among groups of non-state actors say about how agency shifts over time and what this means for governance outcomes in terms of efficiency and democratic legitimacy. A multitude of methodologies is therefore called for to examine questions of agency, legitimacy, and authority in global governance. This paper has provided a tentative model to inspire new research in this area.",

",
      "Key Findings": "In the horticulture sector, PRICE succeeded in job creation; however, while job creation exceeded its Life of Project (LoP) targets, this success is a result of seasonal labor among horticulture farmers. PRICE interventions in the horticulture sector did not regularly create full-time jobs for women. Due to cultural and social limitations, women were only moderately empowered in decision-making about agricultural inputs and production.\n\nPRICE training increased women’s technical skills in horticulture and aquaculture production, specifically at the homestead level, which increased family incomes. PRICE interventions strengthened capacity among aquaculture value-chain actors and for business membership organizations (BMOs) to carry out interventions to resolve sector constraints following project completion. Through PRICE SME initiatives, SMEs were able to gain access to markets, financial services, and training; the aggregation of SMEs into the Leather Technology Small Entrepreneurs Association (LTSE) served as the most valuable SME development initiative.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Given the low domestic demand for horticulture products, USAID should emphasize linking horticulture producers with international exporting processors.\n- Agricultural loans should also facilitate sustainable credit practices through support that identifies and develops business models to provide adequate training and knowledge among beneficiaries.\n- USAID needs to examine how to apply the COEL job creation model in other sectors, as COEL contributed to women’s empowerment and strengthened job creation for women.\n- In the leather sector, future projects should assist large manufacturers in finding price-competitive international markets.",

      "Document Summary": "The Government of Tanzania has developed a number of guiding health policies, strategies, and legislation that support an increased private sector role in the health system through PPP or direct private sector investment. This paper presents options to improve the implementation of these policies, strategies, and legislation aimed at enhancing private sector contributions to health. They include establishing and strengthening institutions and processes for PPP dialogue, involving the PMO-RALG in key MOHSW initiatives, strengthening the capacity of the MOHSW PPP unit, and PPP-TWG focusing efforts to improve communication of PPP strategies and priorities to all levels of the health system. ",
      "Key Findings": "The paper offers a number of options the GOT can pursue in strengthening private sector contributions toward Tanzania’s health system. These efforts all require effective planning, open and transparent multi-sectoral dialogue, and careful monitoring of impacts and outcomes. The conducive national policy environment in Tanzania’s health sector has set a stage for improved public-private partnerships as well as private investments in health to expand fiscal space and enhance service delivery. However, there is a need for continual development of Local Government Authorities (LGAs’) capacity to engage with the private sector, and the need to develop ever more sophisticated and mature mechanisms to finance investments for improved service delivery in health. In terms of PPPs for health, Tanzania is a regional leader, with existing expertise and experience that can be drawn upon as part of the Health Financing Strategy (HFS) reform. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "This paper presents various options and considerations on PPPs as well as providing the GOT with strategies to improve the utility, cost-effectiveness, and resource mobilization of public funds for private health sector engagement. Through effective dialogue, a commitment to mutual benefit, an improved understanding of the PPP mechanism, and careful application with effective monitoring the GOT can significantly improve health outcomes as part of the reformed HFS.",

The selected value chain analysis covers end market analysis, value chain mapping, constraints and opportunities analysis, and strategies to address the constraints and utilize the opportunities. ",
      "Key Findings": "The report highlights that the major constraints associated with Tilapia value chain include the lack of knowledge and access of farmers about using proper inputs and cultivation techniques. Some of the major constraints identified in the vegetable value chain include the lack of knowledge of farmers about using proper inputs and cultivation techniques. Some of the constraints in the sunflower value chain include the unavailability of quality seeds, lack of knowledge of proper cultivation techniques, unwillingness to produce sunflower commercially, rigidity to grow traditional crops only, weak linkage between value chain actors. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Intervention 1: Facilitate the linkage between input companies (seed, fertilizer, chemical) and input retailers in these regions to help them market quality inputs\n\nIntervention 2: Create service provider (seed retailers) to ensure information flow to the vegetable farmers\n\nIntervention 3: Provide trainings and set up demonstrations to showcase better cultivation practices\n\nIntervention 4: Facilitate linkage between farmers and traders by encouraging Farias for vegetable collection from farmers",

      "Key Findings": "Despite many of the challenges noted above and some of the evident risks involved in humanitarian–private sector collaboration, there is significant scope in Jordan for involving businesses in supporting aid agency efforts in a number of ways. With a comparatively developed private sector, strong infrastructure, capable medical, ICT and banking sectors, a high degree of stability and a predominantly urban refugee population, Jordan could be seen as an optimal location for developing and testing collaborations among businesses and aid agencies. There is significant potential to take advantage of opportunities to pilot, monitor and study various forms of humanitarian–private sector engagement with a view to scaling them up in Jordan, Lebanon and elsewhere. Humanitarian and development actors alike felt that there is a crucial opportunity to attempt innovative models in Jordan in order to identify what works and what does not, so that international stakeholders have a useful blueprint from which to operate regionally and, potentially, in future humanitarian, recovery and development operations in neighbouring Syria.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Overarching recommendations include: \n\n1. Help the private sector (and others) understand the international humanitarian system\n2. Raise awareness regarding one another’s capabilities and needs through short-term personnel exchanges\n3. Organise a sub-regional humanitarian affairs forum to feature private sector capabilities and offerings\n4. Engage local suppliers by making procurement plans, current and future, easier to access\n5. Review and rationalise procedures, within the UN or among IASC members, to enable better relations with the business community\n\nStrategic, specific recommendations are: \n\n1. Allow refugees to meet their needs on local markets where feasible\n2. Scale back restrictions on where refugees can use e-vouchers and other cash instruments\n3. More broadly, rationalise cash programming to stem the fragmentation of models\n4. Engage private schools in providing education services to Syrian refugees\n5. Expand fee-for-service healthcare as a de facto public–private partnership",

The report highlights the successes and learning from the project. Accordingly, the report shows that the Rritje project is well run and has achieved most of its qualitative and quantitative objectives. The project’s emphasis and intervention logic have changed over time, and its indicators have changed somewhat. In particular, after an interim evaluation, the project was refocused to emphasize Meso-level interventions more as opposed to its initial exclusive emphasis on company-level interventions. ",
      "Key Findings": "The project achieved all of its qualitative objectives. The quantitative objectives were focused on sales and job growth in areas of trade and investment and private sector productivity improvement. \n\nThe project consistently met its quantitative targets apart from the first year. Sales trajectory is likely to be positive for the sectors considered, footwear, garment, tourism and IT, but job growth will most likely be slower due to greater use of technology in the first three sectors mentioned.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Regional projects:\n- Regional university project to strengthen career based education\n- Regional tourism project to further develop regional tourism based on the National Geographic success of Rritje Albania.\n- Regional association project for selected industries to train associations, discuss common issues and find common solutions.\n\n2. Albania-focused:\n- Tourism project supporting both government and tourist associations developing their structure and skills and developing a detailed national tourism strategy for the next five years.\n-Additional marketing and advanced manufacturing for key industries.\n- Local university support project to increase career-based education, develop curricula to reflect demand for graduates and develop international collaboration to increase research.",

      "Document Summary": "This report sheds light on sustainability-related business model innovations. The report sets out to better understand which new business models are emerging, where innovation is happening, and how both new and established companies are experimenting to embed sustainability into the underlying structure of their businesses. From the research and review of 87 company examples, this paper identifies 20 distinct business models. It offers a closer look at what’s occurring in each of these models to produce more sustainable outcomes. ",
      "Key Findings": "Every exchange in a value chain provides opportunities for innovation and impact. Companies that have demonstrated a business model innovation have often done so by shifting incentives in the value chain. The largest companies tend not to be the source of new models, but they can help evolve and scale them. Lastly, business model innovation doesn’t happen in a vacuum.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Don’t be afraid to question existing models. The first step in building something new is having the courage to examine the current model—as business model thinker Patrick Stähler puts it, getting “all the tacit and unspoken assumptions on the table.” Challenging the dominant logic may, in fact, be the most difficult step, but it’s the only way to move towards identifying new options.\n\n2. Be willing to try something new. If companies are best at maintaining what they already do, recognize that any true business model innovation will require building new skills and applying different capabilities. Innovators should be willing to let go of what made them successful in the past. Some experts recommend taking a “portfolio approach,” maintaining focus on what’s worked before, but dedicating some percentage of resources towards development of entirely new business models.\n\n3. Establish and protect an innovation culture. For business model innovation to succeed, some level of cultural support must be present within the company, or at least within a team responsible for innovation. This includes, but is not limited to, a mission and/ or goals that promote the pursuit of innovative business models; the right management structure allowing for discussion and connection around innovation; incentives for identifying and cultivating breakthrough innovation; and an entrepreneurial mindset, with the ability to prototype, experiment, fail fast, and learn (as with the “lean startup” model).\n",

      "Document Summary": "The end-of-project evaluation of the Capacity Kenya Project (CKP) report sheds light on the successes and lessons learned from the implementation of the CKP as well as discerns new approaches to enhance the effectiveness of the human resources for health (HRH) follow-on program. The report highlights that the CKP has been successful in achieving the vast majority of specific project objectives set forth by OPH and most key performance indicators as outlined in the 2013 PMP. While mentioned in an exhaustive list of outcomes, strategic and effective engagement with the private sector was limited.",
      "Key Findings": "This evaluation points to the following key lessons learned should be considered in the future project design:\n• The importance in formalizing agreements with the government and other relevant stakeholder. \n• The importance of paying careful attention to basic issues such computer skills and connectivity with ICT-driven interventions. \n• The need to consider simple and low-resource interventions that can yield high impact results. \n• The critical role of an effective monitoring and evaluation framework which would be able to measure project outcomes and impacts. Additionally, focus on SMART indicators, which would\nallow for monitoring of project achievement in a comprehensive way.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Several key recommendations relate to gaps in HRH programming, in light of existing projects like FUNZO and LMS:\n Focus on TA and ICT driven programming with a significant training component;\n Use multi-sectoral approach to address HRH and HRD issues, for example;\n Use good practices like RHP recruitment, occupational safety, and work environment interventions (should be picked up by the GoK and/or scaled-up);\n Develop increased knowledge management among development partners, with the provision of documentation detailing support provided by partners to facilitate gap analysis and data use for project design;\n Additional effort toward fostering positive coordination and collaboration between MoH HQ and health teams at the county levels (leadership, coaching, conflict resolution, team building, etc.)\n Strategically coordinate and help private, public and FBO sectors liaise, and exchange experiences. Engage private sector purposefully, based on evidence and their motives, i.e. for strategic advising, training, etc.",

      "Key Findings": "This paper has attempted to extend the theory of co-management into the area of tourism crisis management, using its principles to help inform a framework for developing a TARN in a rural community in Chile. It provides a starting point for both academics and practitioners interested in developing collaborative approaches for crisis management in the field.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It is essential that the TARN be supported by a sound academic research connecting the framework with case studies globally. This type of interconnection between research and application is crucial as we seek solutions to crisis management and disaster planning; not only in Chile, but all around the world. Sound academic research will allow these disparate destinations to identify, measure, and share the common elements for success, avoid\nthe common pitfalls, and “discover” the unique elements of their particular geographies and cultural contexts, such as models of financial support, leadership styles, commitment within the group, trust, etc. Thus, research and documentation of differences in global models will allow for a record of best practices to be made available for destinations, particularly those in the early decision-making stages.",

      "Key Findings": "We identified legitimation work as occurring across objects, audiences, and time. Thus, we introduce legitimation work as the purposeful effort of the legitimacy seeker to avoid certain issues while ensuring other issues that are of importance to the conferrer of legitimacy. These findings contribute to micro-level considerations within institutional theory which view legitimacy as socially constructed between legitimacy seeker and conferrer. Hence, we add another perspective on legitimation to the previously existing conceptualizations of legitimacy as a deterministic consequence of institutionalization.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Further investigations are necessary to sharpen our understanding of legitimation work. Possible research questions include whether the two dimensions of legitimation work, namely avoiding and ensuring, are substitutes, mutually enforcing, additive, or independent from each other. In connection to that, another question is whether the dimensions constitute necessary or sufficient aspects of legitimation work.",

      "Document Summary": "This report sheds light on the importance of public and private partnerships throughout sub-Saharan and the Ivory Coast in the HIV response. It highlights that approximately half of the facilities in the Ivory Coast are for-profit. Thus, the private sector is a key partner that the government can tap into to make the country’s HIV response more sustainable. Further, using the national health accounts (NHA) and HIV subaccounts methodologies, the SHOPS project tracked data on how HIV funds flow through Ivory Coast’s health system and identify implications for how donors and the government can better work with the private health sector. ",
      "Key Findings": "The report highlights the policy and program implications of out-of-pocket payments for general health, which is significant—66 percent of total health expenditures. However, out-of-pocket payments by people living with HIV account for only 3 percent of HIV expenditures. This indicates that donor funding and a government policy abolishing fees for HIV goods and services can reduce the financial burden on those seeking care.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The report suggests that if the government of the Ivory Coast pursues universal health coverage goals, it will need to consider how to fill the role of donors in providing access to and financial risk protection for HIV services in an equitable and sustainable way. Since the barriers to increasing ART enrollment appear to be mostly non-financial, donors may want to pursue additional strategies to scale up the provision of ART in the private sector, where patients may experience shorter wait times and greater perceived confidentiality. When the government of Ivory Coast next conducts a health accounting exercise using the updated version of the NHA methodology, a concerted effort should be made to systematically track resource flows through the private sector to more accurately measure its contribution to the HIV response.\n",

      "Document Summary": "This report gives a brief overview of the institutional strengthening lens through which the Knowledge Network examined good practices in long-term training. It examines eleven topics related to long-term training and, through this lens of institutional strengthening as one of the goals of individual training, identifies good practices in each of these areas to achieve that goal. The report indicates that these ambitious programs achieved some impressive results, according to numerous evaluations with little or no change at the institution. USAID recognized that the principal reason training did not lead in many cases to sustainable institutional change was the lack of a link between the performance needs of an institution and the training offered. ",
      "Key Findings": "Based on learning from the Good Practices in Leveraging Long-term Training for Institutional Capacity Strengthening, the report shares good practices to leverage institutional strengthening. USAID has adapted the International Society for Performance Improvement (ISPI) to apply to the international environment through its Human and Institutional Capacity Development (HICD) framework. Both the ISPI and the HICD models begin the process of institutional strengthening, by comparing the present situation of an organization to its desired future performance. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "The report highlights that preparing trainees to have an impact on their home institutions is an effort that should be undertaken throughout the life of a program – not only towards the end of the training period. Actions for boosting post-training impact on institutional strengthening should be built into a program’s core and should be taken before training begins, during training, and after trainees have returned home.",

It provides direct recommendations to both the Management Entity (ME) and USAID on program implementation issues. ",
      "Key Findings": "The ALSCC Innovation Lab has funded 12 Seed Grant Projects in  East and West Africa, Mongolia and Nepal in years one and two while 10 long term Research Projects were funded and are currently operating in East Africa (4), West Africa (2) and Nepal (4). 10 TIRI scholars  have been funded in East Africa with an additional 18 Scholars funded in Nepal. Six to eight additional TIRI Scholars are likely to be funded in Senegal based upon review of revised research proposals on a team model. In addition, 15 graduate fellows from Africa and Nepal are being supported for post-graduate qualifications either in the US or in host country research/academic institution with six TIRI Scholar Workshops organized in Nepal, Ethiopia and Senegal. Communication and dissemination: The ME created an attractive, informative and current website; also Facebook and LinkedIn profiles. In addition, Research Communiques and other publications serve to disseminate program accomplishments and research findings.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. A focused research strategy emphasizing adaptive capacity for poor livestock keepers and corresponding to Feed the Future priorities should frame and structure all program activities and expenditures.\n2. Research projects should integrate gender and nutrition dimensions and expertise from the start, climate change must be inherent to funded projects, and community demands and interests must shape program focus.\n3. Capacity development activities should be connected to the research dimensions of the projects and focused on durability.\n4. The ME leadership team should proactively develop and guide outreach and communications to internal university and external (USAID Missions, NGOs, universities, policy makers, public and private sector partners) stakeholders as well as to the global donor and academic community in this field.\n5. The ME team’s work should be guided by clear position descriptions tied to program activities and be supported by adequate time allocations for the Director and Associate Director.",

      "Document Summary": "The final report of the Regional Afghan Municipalities Program for Urban Populations (RAMP UP)-South gives an overview of the overall project progress with its achievements, results, key accomplishments, and learnings covering the period from June 2010 and March 2014. The report highlights that between June 2010 and March 2014 RAMP UP-South built the capacity of Afghan municipal staff to deliver essential public services effectively and sustainably. The introduction of new revenue collection and management systems by the project greatly improved the ability of municipal governments to mobilize own-source revenue. The project demonstrated that Afghan ownership was essential to project success and sustainability. Following three years of sustained, targeted training and the provision of strategic resources, RAMP UP-South had established the groundwork for transferring ownership of the project’s key service delivery and revenue generation systems to local authorities. In the final year of implementation, RAMP UP-South completed the successful transfer of two of its anchor programs, SWM and the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS), to municipal control. Transferring management of IFMS rollout to IDLG and GDMA helped ensure their ownership of the implementation process, promoting the sustainability of this model as it is replicated nationwide. Throughout the life of the project RAMP, UP-South focused on building a foundation for administratively and financially sustainable provision of high-quality municipal services.",
      "Key Findings": "The program led to improved public services being provided by municipal governments which were part of the RAMP-UP South program.  Outreach initiatives such as citizen service desk and public information campaigns increased citizen's familiarity and trust with the local government.\n\n217 percent increase in revenue in target municipalities comparing fiscal year 1389 (2010-2011) to 1392 (2013) due to RAMP UP-South supported parcel registration and business licensing activities. 4 public-private partnerships established with RAMP UP-South support, enhancing the quality of public service provision, boosting municipal revenue, and promoting sustainable economic growth. 917 individuals were trained in municipalities and curricula was developed for administrative and technical subjects.\n\nAssessments revealed that business owners across the project municipalities were more willing to pay licensing fees and that municipal registration processes had improved the security and credibility of their businesses. Meanwhile, local citizens attributed improvements in their quality of life to more effective municipal services — particularly SWM and road infrastructure — with a growing number of residents also crediting the municipalities with greater responsiveness, transparency, and accessibility. These gains coincided with tangible service delivery and revenue generation improvements in all the municipalities, as well as substantial progress in citizen engagement and empowerment initiatives for women and youth.",

It examines best practices and lessons learned and extracts useful methods, processes, capacities, alliances, and activities undertaken in productive projects, community participation, public policy development, and strengthening municipal government program components. The evaluation demonstrates the degrees of success and sustainability, to support Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) implementation and provides the ‘why’ and ‘how’ to program designers and activity managers. ",
      "Key Findings": "The evaluation found many sustained organizations, infrastructure works and productive activities, in all departments. Communities and projects were highly motivated, even in the face of adversity, to succeed and expand. Newer associations, especially with unfamiliar crops, needed more support, and rates of failure were higher. ADAM and MIDAS realized great gains in building associativity among some of their productive and public works activities, helping communities begin to reconstruct social fabric damaged by conflict, illicit livelihoods, poverty and the absence of the state. The common goals, training, and support were essential, yet took time to build. Notably these successes were also replicated across communities – when projects involved some combination of campesinos, indigenous groups, and Afro-Colombians.\n\nFurthermore,  families and communities embraced licit opportunities to make a living and avoid the social disintegration, risks to life and livelihood, and shadow markets of illicit crops. In terms of scaling up, established enterprises and associations provided fertile ground for productive activities that change mentalities and scope from subsistence, household levels to efficiency, marketing and a regional economy. Given the ambition and global scope of the proposed peace process, working with the GOC at all levels will be essential. The output-level indicators by which ADAM and MIDAS are known – families supported, hectares planted, jobs created – were flawed both for telling the story of the programs and for monitoring their progress to improve implementation.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Sustainability:\no Leverage positive experiences with current and past community level projects, companies and public works by having them share their experiences in peer-to-peer learning.\no In exit strategies, link producers to networks – peers, as above, but also market actors, government and university technical assistance sources, and financial resources.\n\n- Associativity:\n\no Use genuine participatory methods in bottom-up decision making on productive and public works projects. Build in time for the process, particularly with new associations or groups.\no Diagnose local needs and priorities around associativity, in an inclusive, intergenerational process. This is often promised, but in the rush of implementation it can be compromised.\no Train and monitor implementing staff on inclusivity and respect for self-determination.\n\n- Culture of legality:\no Focus on what beneficiaries need in order to think long-term: credit access, land tenure, education and capacity building options.\no Foster this culture with the same conditions that supported associativity.\n\n- Scaling up:\no Build with experienced associations and companies using the bottom-up, participatory approach to take best advantage of their proven interest and ability to produce.\no Scale projects sufficiently for production and livelihoods that are greater than subsistence level. This goal should supersede attaining output indicators.\no Ensure municipal participation. The peace process should empower municipalities, and their buy-in is a precondition for sustainability and state credibility.\n\n- Monitoring and evaluation:\no Create modern M&E systems for complex environments - adaptive, shorter-cycle, context- and conflict-sensitive, and built around shared stakeholder goals. Avoid privileging output-level results that distort implementation by affecting implementer incentives.\no Work to instill an evaluation culture that permits experimentation in the Mission.\no Manage knowledge intelligently and enlist successful partners to share with others.",

      "Document Title": "Building an Enabling Environment for Agricultural Technology Commercialization: Bridging the Gap Between Innovation and Uptake",
      "Document Summary": "This policy brief focuses exclusively on the enabling environment for the distribution and utilization of agricultural technologies supported by the public sector in developing countries. It offers the reader simple guidelines for improving private-sector-led commercialization activities based on existing literature, general consensus, and best practices from around the world. The content of this brief is focused on three distinct yet overlapping stages of the commercialization chain for agricultural technologies: the provision of public funds for basic research, the further development of research into marketable technologies, and the deployment of technology to smallholders. ",
      "Key Findings": "The report warns that bridging the gap between publicly funded agricultural R&D and its utilization on-farm is a major challenge. Taking actions that target key challenges faced along the commercialization chain - from innovation, through development, to distribution to smallholders - sets the government on a course to successfully connect agricultural research and farmer adoption of agricultural technologies. Reforms of the enabling environment are necessary to attain agricultural transformation through technology-enhanced farming with the potential to raise farm incomes at scale. Institutional and administrative constraints to effective agricultural R&D, restrictions to private-sector distribution and marketing of agricultural technologies, and legal and regulatory barriers to technology adoption must be addressed. In doing so, governments and other stakeholders will be able to drive market-oriented agricultural development and facilitate greater access to agricultural technologies at a lower cost to farmers. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Principle I: Governments should improve the quantity and quality of agricultural R&D and extension services.\n- Ensure effective public-sector investment in basic research.\n- Align national priorities with a demand-led research agenda. \n-Consider alternative mechanisms for agricultural research. \n\nPrinciple 2: Incentivize the private sector to transform research into marketable technologies. \n- Increase access to foreign and domestic research results.\n- Harmonize local, national, and regional agricultural policies. \n- Protect Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). \n- Alleviate constraints to business entry. \n- Select private-sector partners through a process that considers business model design.\n\nPrinciple 3: The legal and regulatory framework should facilitate the adoption of agricultural technologies by smallholders.\n- Alleviate knowledge infrastructure constraints affecting adoption. \n- Broaden and deepen rural financial markets. Build market infrastructure to lower the cost of technology distribution.\n- Promote integrity in agricultural technology.",

      "Document Summary": "This paper analyses whether ‘publicly funded, privately managed’ companies based on the principles of the Public Private Partnership model protects the interests of both the public and private stakeholders, or is this just a means of public subsidizing of private interests? This paper reviews this model from two perspectives: i) whether the PPP model is meant to create synergy between the public and private sectors and termed public-private partnership falls within the parameters defined in the literature on PPP?; and ii) whether the establishment of these companies on this model is a case that is tantamount to the public subsidy of private interests? To answer these questions, this paper reviews evidence at both the primary and secondary levels. The paper presents a theoretical overview of PPPs and explores the role that PPPs play in the social and economic development of a country. “Public Private Partnership: Conceptualizing the Model” reviews literature as to what constitutes such partnerships and what are their main components and features. “PPPs and their Development in Pakistan” provides the country’s context and discusses the emergence of PPP in Pakistan. Finally, the paper analyses the status of these companies as public-private partnerships and concludes the discussion on the subject.",
      "Key Findings": "Government of Pakistan established several ‘publicly funded, privately managed’ companies based on the principles of Public Private Partnership. This paper analyses whether this unique PPP model protects the interests of both the public and private stakeholders, or is this just a means to public subsidizing of private interests? By drawing on evidence from primary and secondary sources, this paper finds that though some elements of PPP are present in these companies, they, as a whole, are not truly public private partnerships. They do, however, represent an innovative relationship between the public and private sectors.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Relying on the respective strengths of each, the paper argues that such a partnership has the potential to create synergy and can lead to positive outcomes through the exchange of knowledge, experience, and expertise between the public and private sectors. A key policy aspect that needs to be embedded in the model’s design is the development of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and the performance review of a private entity against them. In order to minimize potential conflict of interest and rent-seeking by the private sector, the paper emphasizes that the model needs greater degree of transparency and accountability.",

      "Document Summary": "Community-Based Animal Health Workers (CAHW) in the Horn of Africa, an Evaluation for the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, re-examines OFDA support to CAHW projects through an evaluation to determine if the OFDA-funded CAHW program has resulted in improved animal health and husbandry practices; brought about greater access to animal health services and resulted in improved livelihoods in long-term CAHW programming communities. The report identifies areas that could be improved upon in order to strengthen the CAHW program and make it more relevant in meeting current needs.",
      "Key Findings": "The evaluation concluded that many of the challenges facing CAHW systems are at the level of veterinary governance, and the capacities of government veterinary departments to train, regulate, and supervise CAHWs and other para-professionals, and ensure the quality and reliability of supply of veterinary drugs that reach them.  These challenges commonly relate to the protracted under funding of state veterinary services, and continued grey areas in policy and strategy over the roles of the public and private sectors.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The evaluation’s recommendations focus on organizations.\n- NGOs, OFDA, and USAID projects are requested to keep abreast of and update best practice, to further develop guidance on the use of vouchers in emergency response, and to take advantage of mass communication technologies to keep livestock owners and consumers informed about issues such as food safety.\n\n- Quantitative evidence on the state of the veterinary pharmaceutical trade and drug quality is urgently needed. National veterinary services need to continue to strengthen the institutions that can define and regulate roles, and to support access to quality drugs and vaccines whilst effectively monitoring the development of animal health services. Regional bodies such as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) have an important role in facilitating the exchange of knowledge and lessons between member states’ veterinary services.\n\n- Emergency and development donors need to continue to collaborate to support effective and legal private CAHW systems during normal periods so that they can operate effectively during emergencies. Emerging resilience frameworks provide a means to coordinate and harmonize these approaches.",

      "Document Title": "Performance Evaluation of Water Interventions in Urban and Rural Areas of Zimbabwe",
      "Document Summary": "This report examines USAID/Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)–funded water supply interventions in Zimbabwe from fiscal year (FY) 2009 to FY2012 to determine whether they provided adequate access to improved water during the rainy and dry seasons or not. The report assesses five issue areas encompassing 20 specific evaluation questions. The five areas are (1) overall performance and impact, (2) efficiency, (3) coverage and design, (4) sustainability, and (5) gender equality and equity. ",
      "Key Findings": "The majority of water quality samples (70%) from RWH tanks were of excellent quality (based on local CIMAS and global WHO standards). The majority of water quality samples (79%) from protected wells, however, were of unsatisfactory quality in the dry season.  Almost all of the water quality samples from protected wells and RWH systems were unsatisfactory in the rainy season and only 4% of rural water samples were of excellent or satisfactory quality. Regardless of the actual water quality, a high percentage (>93%) of respondents from urban and rural households with RWH systems and protected wells perceived that water was of good quality (i.e. odorless, colorless and good taste) both in the dry and rainy seasons.\n\nUsing an average of results, the report highlights that none of the water system types evaluated provides a basic level of service. The major issues influencing the achievement or non-achievement of the objectives include the following: changes in rain patterns; sharing of water sources; using water for purposes other than drinking or handwashing. Regarding impact, the report discovers that many households in urban areas use multiple sources. This unexpected finding made it difficult to determine the contribution of the USAID/OFDA-funded sources to an improved water supply. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on these findings, the report provides both the strategic and tactical recommendations to be considered to improve the project performance. They are; i) Ensure that USAID partners conduct all water infrastructure interventions, even in emergencies, select the most efficient water supply model for the context using the concepts of the Technology Applicability Framework, and USAID should only consider funding RWH in a peri-urban setting closer to markets for parts and artisans for building and rooftops adequate for water collection, ii) USAID/OFDA could address poor functioning systems by funding water supply programs that ensure full coverage in a defined geographic area and should consider construction guarantees with their contractors or performance-based contracts, iii) USAID/OFDA should consult with one of the development banks or the African Council of Ministers of Water on ways to provide support to DDF on the budgetary front if they are to effectively undertake their mandate, and iv) USAID/OFDA should utilize evidence-based “next practices” for mainstreaming gender issues into the designing, planning, and maintenance stages of OFDA-funded projects to ensure that appropriate and sustainable systems are in place.",

The strategy of using direct participation in actual research projects was an effective method for building capacity in basic and applied research. IMB has satisfactorily achieved its marine biology objectives in knowledge sharing and skill technology transfer, UNDIP and UNHAS have begun to improved their institutional marine biology training capacity, and selected lecturers have improved their capacity to conduct basic and applied research addressing the important topic of multi-drug resistance (MDR) isolates. Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) institutional management and program staff should be commended for the initiative and leadership they demonstrated in implementing the institutional strengthening, improved knowledge and skills, capacity building, and enrollment increase (women and men) in the geothermal program.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. ‘Documentation/dissemination’ of results for the local consumer. \n2. ‘Champions’ to understand and advocate for supportive policy. \n3. Continued ‘funding’ to further achieve individual and institutional sustainability. \n4. Further demonstration of Indonesian ‘financial and management capability’ with accountability.\n5. Strengthen Partner ‘work force’ linkage opportunities and leadership opportunities for women.",

      "Document Title": "The Dynamics of Employment Growth",
      "Document Summary": "This report discusses preliminary cross-country evidence from a microdata project, called DynEmp, originating from the first wave of the project (DynEmp Express). A number of findings provide useful information to help understand the persistently high unemployment levels and disappointing growth performance in many advanced economies. The report describes the dynamism of different economies, focusing on the process of creative destruction, the role of young businesses in job creation, and their growth dynamics and potential. Furthermore, the impact of the “Great Recession” on both creative destruction and young businesses is investigated, focusing on how the financial crisis has impacted jobs and firms in different countries and which firms have been hit hardest by the recession. ",
      "Key Findings": "First, the analysis showed significant cross-country differences not only in the weight that small firms have in terms of employment, but also in their age profile, e.g., in some countries, small firms are systematically older. \n\nSecond, it has been carefully documented that the group of young firms, i.e., firms that are five years of age or younger, contribute positively to aggregate job creation in nearly every period and country considered. This was shown to be driven to a large extent by the contribution from entrants as well as higher growth rates of surviving young businesses.\n\nThird, there is evidence of a clear decline in start-up rates found across a wide set of countries and the existence of an “up-or-out” dynamic for young businesses. \n\nFourth, the analysis provides evidence on the growth performance of young firms, showing again striking cross-country differences in the data. \n\nFifth, the report shows that young firms were relatively more affected by the Great Recession compared to old ones, both via job creation and via job destruction. However, the main drivers of the aggregate decline in employment were old firms, given their larger weight in the economy. Moreover, the contribution to net employment growth of young firms remained positive during the crisis.\n\nAnd, finally, during the Great Recession there has been a further decrease in the entry rate of new firms, which was already steadily declining in most countries since the beginning of the last decade. Given the importance of firm entry on a host of economic outcomes beyond job creation (e.g. innovation, competition, productivity) this finding raises particular concerns.",
      "Key Recommendations": "-  Going forward, the aim of further analyses are, on the one hand, to link the observed cross-country differences in firms’ dynamism to national policies and framework conditions, affecting entrepreneurship, experimentation and the growth of firms.\n\n- This will rely on the second phase of the data collection DynEmp v2, with more detailed industry breakdowns, as well as having a closer look on high-growth enterprises.\n\n- On the other hand, in order to gain a better understanding of the link between employment dynamics and economic growth and productivity, a parallel analysis and data collection is planned, called MultiProd, collecting micro-aggregated data on output and productivity, in a similar manner to DynEmp.\n\n- This will allow the subsequent analysis to shed light on questions such as what drives productivity differences at the aggregate level, why some countries are better at allocating resources to more productive firms than others, and what is the role of policies in achieving better outcomes both in terms of productivity and of employment.",

      "Document Title": "Nepal Economic, Agriculture, and Trade Activity  Performance Evaluation",
      "Key Findings": "In terms of enabling policy and business environment, public-private dialogues (PPDs) were noted as important activities in successfully promoting stakeholder engagement. The several Government of Nepal (GON) ministries involved reported success in ministry coordination, stakeholder engagement, and the effectiveness of NEAT’s project implementation. For food security and four agricultural value chains, the report notes that the 2.5-year duration was too short. Many of the participants wanted a longer program more in line with the original 5-year program that was approved. Many farmers claimed they were just grasping how to implement learned skills when the program ended while there was an increase in lentil production but this was achieved by male farmers. Female farmer's yield actually declined. The sustainability of the NEAT program was hindered by its failure to focus on training local agricultural development officers who could continue NEAT’s work in the future",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Consider splitting large, multi-faceted programs to narrow topic focus and reduce implementation complications. NEAT was a large and diverse program, which could understandably present size-related complications.\n- Ensure stakeholder engagement with all key stakeholders and from the onset of programming. Respondents from the business sector shared their dissatisfaction in not being involved in decision making from the onset, stating that the programs were very government-focused.\n- Encouraging farmers to use new hybrid seeds needs to be carefully considered. Although productive, hybrid seeds usually must be repurchased each year.\n- Access to finance initiatives within similar programs should be included, as these activities empower the farmers to participate in other program interventions, such as training, capacity building, and purchasing of appropriate seeds, among others.",

The only information we were able to find was on the group approach, such as farmer field schools, thrift and credit, and use of ICTs and training. However, none of these were focused on women farmers. Entrepreneurship was also mentioned as an approach to reaching women.",

According to YB‘s theory of change, young people learn to internalize a sense of personal and civic responsibility less via seminars and roundtables than direct, hands-on practice. Through taking on tasks that teach by doing, through contributing to the production of tangible outputs that improve the lives of others, young people gain a sense of personal and collective efficacy that makes them more resilient, persevering and engaged. In the words of one participant,. \"The project has empowered us: if capable and strong young people decide to move and take an action and to influence those who are decision makers, we can make many changes.\" Project experience validated this strategy.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Greater Emphasis on Livelihoods\nRegardless of the many troubling social, political, and cultural issues in BiH, it is clear that young people overwhelmingly need help with employment.\n\nCommunity Asset Building Motivates Young People\nThe activity most highlighted by participants in the evaluation is community asset building. This YELC component engaged and mobilized young people who were idle but seeking a way to\n―plug in to their communities outside of political activity.\n\nBiH Needs a National-Scale Youth Engagement Program\nThe intertwined trends of youth discouragement, youth marginalization, and youth unemployment do not bode well for the future of BiH. The frustration that young people voice over local politics, local media, outdated attitudes, political corruption, and economic stagnation is intense.",

      "Document Title": "Waste Management Technologies in Regions, Georgia: Solid Waste Collection and Recycling System Assessment Report",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on assessment observations and findings related to the existing SWM situations in the target regions, the following are recommended focus areas for Project assistance activities. Preliminary actions plans for proposed assistance sub‐activities for the coming year are presented in Annex 2.\nKakheti Region ‐ The individual relationships that exist between Kakheti municipalities and their LLC operating companies presents a classic and holistic SWM planning and development approach to solid waste management at the local level with some development elements that extend to the\nregional and, possibly, national context. Due to the existing national procurement law concerning the\ntender and contracting process for the LLCs, it is difficult to envision that there will be significant\ncompetition for the existing LLCs in the near term. A scenario similar to that in Adjara where the\nBatumi LLC provides regional services to all of the municipalities in the region is not likely in Kakheti\ngiven the relative size of the municipalities and the geographical distances between them.\nAccordingly, the existing LLCs should be considered as having a longer term relationship with the\nmunicipalities than the 1 year contract limit required by the national procurement law.\nAccordingly, the recommended assistance should focus on assisting the Kakheti municipalities and\ntheir respective LLCs in developing municipal solid waste management plans based on an anticipated\nlocal requirement for such plans in the pending legal framework and national strategy requirements.\nThe new code is expected to include a local requirement for incorporating recycling, recovery, and\ncomposting processes as a means for diverting solid waste components from landfill disposal as is\ncurrently mandated in E.U. SWM programs. The context for the municipal solid waste management\nplans will be the anticipated requirements as currently stipulated in the working draft of the new\nsolid waste law which states the following relative to the required content of the municipal solid\nwaste management plans: \nArticle 13 Municipal Waste Management Plan\n(1) Each municipality shall adopt a plan for the management of the municipal waste\nproduced within its territory for a period of five years. A Municipal Waste\nManagement Plan may be prepared jointly by neighbouring municipalities. The\nMunicipal Waste Management Plan shall be compliant with the National Waste\nManagement Plan and other plans under Article 12 paragraph 7 of this Law.\n(2) The adoption of the Municipal Waste Management Plan shall be preceded by public\nconsultations, involving the relevant stakeholders and the neighbouring\nmunicipalities. These public consultations shall be carried out by the respective\nmunicipality(ies).\n(3) The Municipal Waste Management Plan shall contain the following:\na) Information on the existing system for collection of waste from population;\nb) Data on the types and the amounts of non‐hazardous waste from population\ncollected, recovered and disposed of;\nc) Data on the types and the amounts of hazardous waste from population\ncollected, recovered and disposed of;\nd) Location of the waste treatment facilities;\ne) Planned measures to be taken for the establishment of separate collection and\nrecovery of municipal waste, including of biodegradable waste and packaging\nwaste; \nf) Planned construction of new waste treatment facilities;\ng) Programmes to raise awareness of the public on waste management issues;\nh) Implemented and planned measures for co‐operation with other municipalities\nin the field of waste management;\ni) The way and timeframe in which the proposed measures shall be implemented,\nresponsible persons, estimated costs and sources of financing for their\nimplementation.\n\nThese expected requirements should be the template for assistance provided to the Kakheti\nmunicipalities in developing their plans. If these requirements are changed in the final enactment of\nthe law, the municipal ISWM plan development process should be modified accordingly. Specific\nactivities that will be important considerations of working with the municipalities to develop the\nrecommended municipal solid waste management plans will, at a minimum, include the following:\n Increasing the institution capacity of the municipalities to manage the contractual relationship\nwith their LLC companies and to increase their financial capacity to make appropriate decisions\nconcerning service budgeting, system coverage expansion and periodic capital investments.\n Optimizing solid waste companies (but treating them somewhat as a municipal function due to\nthe tender process which almost assures their continuity in providing collection and cleansing\nservices) including defining the means for achieving service coverage expansion in conjunction\nwith capital investment decisions by the municipalities.\n Informal dump closure and remediation, if necessary (assumed to be treated as municipal\nfunction in the finally adopted national law and strategy).\n Defining the amount and type of solid waste that must be managed by the municipal system.\n Defining the type, amount and current disposal or recovery practices of other waste stream\ncomponents (industry, agribusiness, etc.) that exist in the region and that may be subject to the\nrequirements of the new law and national strategy.\n Sorting plant (or other recovery process) economic/technical viability assessment and design (to\ndetermine how such plants (or any other means for achieving the new law diversion objectives)\ncan become viable cost effective component of a municipality’s solid waste management plan)\nAdjara Autonomous Republic ‐ Because of the regional aspects of the SWM collection program in\nAdjara and the level of development supported by the EBRD in their project due diligence, planning\nand implementation process, the Project’s assistance activities in Adjara should be focused on\nselectively supporting specific stakeholders on specific issues of concern. Project assistance activity\nfocus areas should include the following:\n Municipal capacity building in: 1) the collection service tender/contract and collection\nperformance monitoring processes and 2) the collection service coverage expansion planning\nand implementation process. (This is intended to give the Adjara municipalities (outside of\nBatumi) an enhanced voice in collection/transport service delivery and coverage while helping\nthem understand the pros and cons of regional collection/transport program versus locally‐\nbased services.\n Recycling and recovery realities and private sector business plans to enhance market conditions\nfor future public sponsored recovery programs (As the key element of Component 2 of the\nProject, this should be done in conjunction with capacity building in the municipalities to\nunderstand the technical, business and economic aspects of the “sorting plants” that they have\nall expressed an interest in developing in their municipalities)\n Landfill technical and operational capacity building and operational planning with the Hygiene LTD state company at the time when the new regional landfill is about to come into operation\nBoth Regions ‐ The following are recommended Project activity focus areas that are anticipated\nto apply to both target regions (and may also have national applicability):\n Tariff Reform and Cost Recovery – While this is the important function of Component 3 of the\nProject, the need for effective optimized cost recovery will need to be emphasized as a key\nelement of developing the proposed municipal solid waste management plans in the Kakheti\nmunicipalities. In developing their SWM plans, the Kakheti municipalities will begin to\nunderstand the economic impact of enhanced SWM standards and programs with tariff reform\nand resulting enhanced cost recovery as a key objective of implementing their SWM plans.\n Public Outreach and Education ‐ While this is the important function of Component 4 of the\nProject, the development of the municipal ISWM plans in the Kakheti region must also focus on\nthe need and means for public understanding of 1) the future roles that waste generators in an\nenhanced ISWM system may have in the future particularly as it relates to an increased\nemphasis on recycling/recovery processes, 2) the evolution of waste generator willingness to\npay for better services based on environmental improvements (Unfortunately, willingness to pay\nfor effective environmentally sound landfills (which few people physically see) is often different\nfrom a willingness to pay for better collection service which everybody sees in their daily lives.)\nThis will need to be resolved in the Project design of its Public Awareness elements as they\nrelate to the above regional activities in addition to the general public awareness objectives\nassociated with the overall solid waste management process.)\n Closure requirements and processes ‐ Capacity building for the SWMCG in Kakheti and Hygiene\nLTD in Adjara for closure of currently active disposal areas when regional E.U. standard landfills\nbecome available in each target region.\n Closure requirements and processes ‐ Capacity building for closure and rehabilitation of the\ninformal dumping sites in municipal areas where formal collection is now provided now or in the\nfuture through coverage expansion.",

",
      "Key Recommendations": "This study makes the following recommendations: help the private sector and aid agencies understand one another; develop strategic communications materials to capture the wide variety of private sector collaborations with aid agencies; ensure strategic and operational dialogue takes place between relevant private sector actors and aid agencies on a regular basis; ensure aid agency country offices businesses' branches are able to draw upon and activate existing global partnerships, etc. ",

This will keep your deep dives focused and relevant.\n\nTo simplify the research process, narrow down your focus on the most interesting regions for deeper probing. Identify major characteristic differences or redundancies between areas and make an informed decision to whether or not to include the area for further probing.\n\nAfter your deep dives, consolidate your findings into a PowerPoint-style report with raw data and visuals. Don’t forget to take pictures!\n\nBe specific on the details as you share stories – focusing on what precisely market actors said in their experiences and perceptions is critical to avoid letting the team’s biases into the research and analysis",

      "Document Title": "Waste Management Technologies in Regions, Georgia: National Waste Management Code Review",
      "Key Findings": "In general, the proposed waste code, as defined by the June 16, 2014 draft, will provide a meaningful legal framework by which to undertake planning for effective solid waste management programs throughout Georgia. However, there is considerable work to be done given the current state of solid waste management in Georgia and the improvements required to achieve the desired outcomes of the new waste code. The finalization of a national strategy as well as the development of national and municipal SWM plans will be important in establishing the actual roadmap to be followed in achieving the necessary improvements. Fortunately, the Association Agreement, in addition to its stipulated mandates, also provides an opportunity to learn from the experiences gained in other countries who have worked towards improving their solid waste management programs to E.U. standards. These experiences will be valuable both in planning as well as the physical implementation of alternative approaches that are technically and economically viable.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. The Ministry should undertake a detailed assessment of existing solid waste management practices and facilities throughout Georgia to serve as a baseline for establishing its overall national strategy and plan and, ultimately, measuring national (as well as regional and municipal) progress in achieving the intent of the new waste code.\n\n2. The Ministry should develop or support a comprehensive public awareness and education program concerning the basis of the proposed waste code and the need to improve SWM services and\nfacilities. \n\n3. The Ministry should undertake a detailed assessment of the cost implications of the proposed outcomes of the new waste code as a basis for effective economic resource planning and the development of the national strategy and plan as well as for development of subsequent municipal SWM plans. \n\n4. Since in the waste code will apply to all municipalities throughout Georgia, the ministry should develop or support a program to increase the technical and managerial capacity of municipal\nofficials that will be responsible for developing local SWM plans and implementing the processes and facilities that are required to comply to the intent of the new waste code.\n\n5. The proposed sub‐law on hazardous waste should be as specific as possible in defining the manner by which waste materials would be classified as either hazardous and nonhazardous along with the\nprocess that will be utilized by the government in assuring and enforcing compliance.

It also led to increased knowledge of taking SP and malaria prevention during pregnancy.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- The message was aired on national radio and TV stations but not regional ones.  Campaign exposure can be increased with the addition of regional radio networks.\n\n- Uptake of SMS service was low. It is recommended that referral to the SMS platform be given more prominence –possibly even its own dedicated radio and TV spots and/or print materials.\n\n- Since 35.1% of the women who did not give birth at a health facility reported that they could not make it to a hospital in time. Future campaign should also emphasize the importance of moving closer to a health facility, when possible, as one's due date approaches.",

      "Document Title": "Analysis of USAID/Colombia’s Public-Private Partnerships",
      "Key Findings": "The private sector’s main incentive to join USAID in post-conflict zones is, not surprisingly, to pursue business opportunities such as those shown in Figure 3. USAID has focused much PPP effort on connecting local producers with large commercializing companies. This approach has resulted in short-term successes, with low risk. Generally these efforts involve local associations and private companies who have previously worked with USAID programs such as MIDAS.\n\nPPPs have also been used to reach development goals beyond economic growth for its own sake. Costs, timelines, and other challenges are generally greater, but when the development benefits are deemed important, these can be useful PPPs. One such set of\nUSAID/Colombia efforts (key to this analysis) targets the reintegration of ex-combatants. The research found that large companies are reluctant to hire ex-combatants, though SMEs at times find it worthwhile, with the right incentives. But the logic behind other PPPs – of helping many under one scheme – may not be applicable to these varied and highly vulnerable groups.\n\nPPPs have served to increase beneficiaries’ licit incomes, particularly in the short term but with good prospects for mid- and long-term economic gains as well. Success in these outcomes depends on a proper combination of short- and long-term income solutions for\nvulnerable beneficiaries. Other benefits are social and familial, particularly where these benefits are explicitly sought.\n\nThe analysis concludes that successful and expanding PPPs are\nlargely based on the interaction of trustworthy private partners and strengthened beneficiaries, in a context that offers competitive advantages and a set of minimum contextual conditions for doing businesses. The team did not find any relation between the magnitude of the private sector financial contribution and PPP sustainability. The reputation of the private company, however, is critical to building trust and commitment from targeted populations.\n\nUSAID has a symbiotic relationship with several programs of the GOC in\nimplementing PPPs. CELI coordinates with the PAP of the Ministry Agriculture, CORE coordinates with ACR, and ACIP works closely with the Productive Transformation Program (PTP) of the Ministry of Commerce. On the other hand, in spite of USAID efforts toward improving local business conditions, the private sector remains highly distrustful of local governments. These have a reputation for being weak and for lacking interest in providing technical support to beneficiaries. Many actors believe that incorporating local governments in PPPs may even reduce the chances of sustainability.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Strategic approach\nUSAID has had significant successes with many PPPs by taking advantage of opportunities that\narise to link small producers with markets. USAID’s good name ensures that potential partners\nwill participate, even incurring some risk, in order to potentially gain through expanded value\nchains. However, some of the purely development goals the Mission seeks will remain out of\nreach under this model, as described below.\nThe Mission will need to take a more active role in securing alliances outside its most prevalent\n\nmodel, focusing on geographic and thematic areas that can more directly target particular post-\nconflict benefits. To reach these goals, the analysis recommends a strategy focused on three\n\nsteps: 1) identification of opportunities; 2) development of business plans and 3) promotion and\nstrengthening activities.\nA. Identification of Business Opportunities\nThe identification of business opportunities in transitional zones requires the following:\n• A comprehensive assessment of the agricultural products or raw materials that are lacking\nin Colombia and that could be produced by each conflict-affected region;\n• An inventory of the production capabilities that these regions offer, including an analysis\nof the reduction of agricultural production as a result of internal displacement, the\noutlook for land that will be made accessible after conflict (i.e. natural parks, mining and\nenergy production) and the abandoned infrastructure that can still be recovered; and\n• A market study that identifies the changes in demand for goods and services by the\ninhabitants of such emerging markets, and the companies likely to fill these needs.\nB. Development of business plans\nBusiness plans should prioritize PPPs associated with productive sectors with high potential.\nCriteria for selecting sectors may follow existing GOC criteria (e.g., the “World Class sectors”\nidentified by the Ministry of Commerce in its PTP.) As these alliances will likely be with\npartners that are less experienced with such activities, and with more, smaller partners, greater\n\ntechnical assistance (TA) will likely be required. Identifying opportunities for integrating ex-\ncombatants will require that USAID move away from the models of large numbers per project, in\n\norder to seize opportunities at a micro level. This includes understanding the employment needs\nof SMEs and exploring opportunities to support ex-combatants’ own value chain\nentrepreneurship, individually and in small associations.\nC. Promotion activities\nDeveloping business plans and promoting new investments among the private sector will require\ntechnical resources that USAID does not currently have. At present, USAID’s programs are\ndesigned to prioritize strengthening and linking local producers in supply chains. It will be\nnecessary to evaluate whether an additional program should undertake investment banking and\nincubator-type activities, including the formulation of business plans and the promotion of\ninvestment among those opportunities identified by the Mission.\nD. Strengthening activities\nActivities should build upon USAID’s successful approaches to strengthening producer\nassociations and other beneficiaries’ employment and entrepreneurship skills. It also may require\ncomplementing existing governance and consolidation efforts with a national good governance\ninitiative. This initiative could be focused in strengthening transparency and efficiency of the\nGOC for improving infrastructure and access to social services in post-conflict regions.\nA critical line of action is related to local governance strengthening programs in post-conflict\nregions: to create enabling environments for business, it will be necessary improve transparency\nand accountability of local governments, and to construct greater capacity to advocate for\ninfrastructure and social services resources.\n2. Diversify approach to different types of companies for PPPs targeting reintegration\nStigmatization, lack of social and technical skills and illegality should be taken into account\nwhen PPPs are designed to offer economic opportunities for ex-combatants. Businesses will\nexpect that ex-combatants will receive ongoing psychological and vocational support from\nUSAID and GOC, beyond their entrance to PPPs.\nBusiness motivations to participate in PPPs to provide economic opportunities to ex-combatants\ndepend on the size of the company and its corporate responsibility agenda. Possible approaches\nto diversify USAID’s approach include:\n• Because SMEs are more likely to hire ex-combatants, develop a model tailored for these\ncompanies, starting with market research on the SMEs’ needs for personnel and financial\nand technical support. Accompany activities with outreach and communications\nstrategies targeting SMEs.\n• Encourage large Colombian companies to procure goods and services from SMEs that\nemploy demobilized combatants. One example would be proposing that Ecopetrol and\nPacific Rubiales give preferential scoring to proposals from SMEs that employ\ndemobilized combatants. This does not require disclosure of ex-combatants’ names.\nRather, companies that certify that a portion of their permanent staff comes from this\npopulation could simply be given preferential scoring. This approach is used by the GOC,\nwhich awards additional points to those companies hiring ethnic minorities and disabled\npopulations.\n• Identify other, less capital-intensive income generation alternatives for ex-combatants.\nSuch alternatives may include vocational or entrepreneurial training for self-employment,\nor opportunities with supported small- and medium-sized enterprises.\n3. Define integral change as the goal for beneficiaries\nUSAID’s main target is to improve living conditions of beneficiaries. However, success is\nmeasured through ‘hard indicators’ such as income and employment generation. This can leave\nother significant dimensions of change outside of the approach and measurement. Some ideas for\nencouraging implementing partners to pursue a more integrated approach to beneficiaries are:\n• Target not only individuals but also families through complementary programs to access\nsocial services such as education for children and women; access to psycho-social and\nsexual and reproductive health services; and formalization of property.\n• Strategically promote income generation in short-, medium- and long-term approaches.\nMost projects visited focused on long-term yield activities. Consider expanding PPPs that\nprovide short-term income (i.e. using existing underutilized capacities and short yield\ncrops), and exploring side-businesses for other family members to permit immediate\nincome to the household (i.e. training and self-employment for spouses and youth).\n• Complement existing indicators with those that help track changes in living conditions.\n4. Improve MONITOR to track standard variables.\nUSAID/Colombia’s has introduced important improvements in its monitoring data storage\nsystem (MONITOR). The Mission will need to ensure considerable follow-up on implementer\ncompliance, and that the guidelines allow for the use of the data for decision-making.\nIn order to better assess PPPs in light of the ‘function of success’ described above, the Mission\nshould consider developing indicators that allow tracking other important dimensions, such as:\n• Productive sector of the PPP, and product and service produced by the PPP.\n• Data on the private sector partner (i.e. size, sector(s), years of existence, etc.) and\ncontact information for more than one team member.\n• Data on local partners (i.e. association, community council, individuals, etc.),\nincluding previous participation with GOC or international donors.\n• Contribution by partner (i.e. financial contribution, types and estimated values of\nin-kind contributions, types of TA).\n• Defining if the PPP is new, expanding or replicating a previous project.\n• Training implementing partners in Data Quality Analysis\n\nThe Mission should be using MONITOR data to track those PPP aspects that show more\npromising outcomes, and looking for successful combinations. A mutually agreed new set of\nreports could help the Mission’s decision-making process. Clear data requirements, follow-up\nand use of the data for decision-making are essential for such a significant investment from\nUSAID. An initial set of indicator categories is presented in Annex 11.",

      "Key Findings": "This paper addresses recent calls to study the role of the state in private regulation. Integrating current scholarship on the state as a catalyst of private regulatory regimes with prior literature on regulatory failure and self-regulation, it identifies and problematizes unsettled assumptions used as a starting point by this growing body of research. The case study traces the evolution of public debates and the interaction of different regulatory initiatives dealing with corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues in Canada’s mining industry. Findings reveal the conditions\nunder which the state is more likely to encourage firm-level, fragmented initiatives than facilitate and promote industrywide regulatory strengthening and consolidation. I discuss the need for greater analytical precision regarding the variation in regulatory policy preferences across time and branches of government and the interaction between public and private regulatory initiatives. The conclusion outlines suggested areas for future research as well as the likely outcome of Canada’s current CSR policy framework.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The Borderless Alliance, even though relatively young, is already starting to generate a tangible impact on-the-ground in facilitating intra-regional and cross-border trade in West Africa. It has already achieved significant results in reducing bribes along road corridors, and up to a 50% reduction in port processing time (achieved by reducing the number of checkpoints along the corridor). As stakeholders continue to build upon increasing efficiencies, all core report recommendations made in 2012 (in the Lome-Ouagadougou Transport and Logistics Cost study) have been implemented. Since its establishment, the Borderless Alliance campaign advocacy methods and USAID Trade Hub-supported private-sector coalition to increase trade have leveraged significant transport efficiency impacts behind and on the border. Ultimately, it has created a platform for private sector engagement in the sub-regional trade policy-making process; and provided significant business networking opportunities which have encouraged intensification of intra-West African trade and investment flows.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The success of the WATH-supported Borderless Alliance in decreasing time and cost to trade in West Africa offers several lessons for future Hub initiatives.\n\n- First, intensive ongoing stakeholder engagement is fundamental to effectively addressing the formidable challenges posed by NTBs in a systemic manner.\n\n- Second, programs that publish data showing trade inefficiencies can be used to pressure policymakers to adopt business-friendly policies. Such programs are relatively inexpensive and effective ways to decrease the prevalence of bribes.\n\n- Finally, when programs have the support of the public and private sectors and show measurable results, they can be self-sustaining.",

However, at the division level,\nthe distribution of unmet need and slack capacity at facilities varies. In two of the five divisions (Badagry and Ikorodu), a modest scale-up could more than meet any need not currently served. The private sector is especially capable of adding patients in Ikeja division, with providers able to take more than eight times the current unmet need. However, in Epe division the number of people who are eligible for ART but are not receiving it still exceeds the number of cases that could be served by the existing private providers.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Given the findings of this study and in consideration of the\nincreasing importance of the regional platform, a few key\nareas emerge for action.\nRecommendation #1: Develop a communication plan for\nraising awareness of the importance of regionalization\nand regional programming within USAID Washington and\nbilateral missions. Regional organizations are recognized by\nAfrican governments and international donors as key players\nwith strong policy influence. It is paramount for USAID to\ncontinue working with them as partners. The interviews\nand literature reviewed as part of this study reveal a lack of\nunderstanding related to the roles of regional organizations\nand processes of regional integration. Efforts must be made\nto demystify the topic and ultimately build consensus around\npriorities for engagement.\nRecommendation #2: Foster direct engagement and policy\ndialogue with regional networks and associations. Regional\nnetworks and associations have a keen understanding of\nrealities on the ground and play a key role in elevating policy\nissues and advocating for change. RECs and international\npartners should continue to engage with regional networks\nand associations to support policy monitoring and the role\nout of standards.\nRecommendation #3: Continue efforts to strengthen the\norganizational capacity of regional networks and associations.\nMany regional networks and associations have significant\norganizational weaknesses. In-depth organizational capacity\nassessments could be conducted to identify capacity gaps and\nfacilitate organizational capacity development interventions\nin the identified areas. Understanding individual networks’\nstrengths and weaknesses will allow potential partners\n(including USAID) to make better informed decisions about\nwho to work with.",

      "Key Findings": "Through the project, USAID supported the Ministry of Health, NGOs, and select educational and professional institutions in strengthening their institutional capacities and performance to promote a functional and democratic Palestinian health sector that is able to meet public health priorities. From 2008 to 2013, the project worked to achieve this goal through: 1) improving governance and management practices in the health sector, 2) improving the quality of essential clinical and community-based health services, and 3) increasing the availability of essential commodities to achieve health and humanitarian assistance goals. In 2014, the project continued exclusively on one component, which was to work toward improving governance and management practices and the quality of clinical services in the health sector through expansion of a computerized health information system (HIS).\n\nChapter One presents an overview of the project’s achievements. It also includes as a supplement “Voices of Impact,” a multimedia series in which Palestinian health care providers describe how the project has improved their capacity to serve Palestinian citizens. Chapter Two highlights the effective management promoted by the project in the health sector, and Chapter Three demonstrates the improvements in quality achieved in health services provided by the Ministry of Health and NGOs. At the end of each of those two chapters, the project shares promising practices and lessons learned during implementation and recommends future interventions to support the Ministry of Health in reforming and developing the health system. Annexes provide additional information, including key technical deliverables, interventions by region, and a summary table of indicators for the project’s performance monitoring plan (PMP) and HIS manuals.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. A) Continue to institutionalize HIS as a national health management system, B) Build the capacity of Ministry of Health central institutions to use HIS for strategic planning, and C) Increase district level manager support for the HIS installed at PHC clinics.\n\n2. Strengthen the capacity of the National Calibration and Training Center to institutionalize strategic procurement and preventive maintenance practices across the ministry.\n\n3. Facilitate operationalization of the EPS and SOC as tools for planning for PHC service delivery.\n\n4. Continue a multi-sectoral approach to foster coordination in planning and delivery of health services nationwide.\n\n5. Create a resource library at the Ministry of Health for ministry planning and donor interventions.\n\n6. Build on the adoption of community health worker CHCE criteria by providing bridging training to existing community health workers to enable them to apply for formal recognition.",

Using data collected from 49 members of a rural social enterprise in North India, we examine the relationships between social entrepreneurship, empowerment and social change. Innovative business processes that\nfacilitated women’s economic activity and at the same time complied with local social and cultural norms that constrain their agency contributed to changing the social order itself. We frame emancipatory social entrepreneurship as processes that (1) empower women and (2) contribute to changing the social order in which women are embedded. \n",

      "Key Findings": "As concepts of corporate social responsibility (CSR) continue to evolve, the predicament facing CSR managers when attempting to balance the\ndiffering interests of various stakeholders remains a persistent management challenge. A review of the extensive literature in this\nfield reveals that the conceptualisation of corporate approaches to responsible stakeholder management remains underdeveloped. In particular, CSR practices within the specific context of the pharmaceutical industry, a sector which particularly dramatically depicts the stakeholder management dilemmas faced by business managers, has been under-researched. To address this gap, this paper\nutilises qualitative, exploratory data, obtained via multiple research methods, to investigate the CSR practices of major pharmaceutical companies in the UK and Germany. The data are employed to critically re-examine and revise a previously published explanatory framework\nwhich identifies the management steps involved in CSR stakeholder\nengagement. The resulting revised explanatory framework\nis the main contribution of this paper. By abstracting those\nfactors which influence CSR practice, it provides an analytical tool\nwhich is designed to be of practical use for business decision-makers when managing their stakeholder engagement activities. Given that the research addresses values and ideals and prescribes practical recommendations for practitioners, it is essentially applied and normative in nature. Ultimately, the framework proposes a set of steps for developing CSR strategies which could help CSR professionals to make a ‘mindset transition’ from a narrower ‘traditional’ approach to CSR to a more innovative way of thinking.

      "Document Title": "Final Evaluation of the USAID/Alianzas Project",
      "Key Findings": "With regard to the relevance and consistency of the Project, most of the stakeholders consulted agreed in recognizing that despite the weaknesses of project implementation, the intervention was consistent and relevant with respect to the original concept and principles of the Project. At the same time, all recognize RTI as a facilitating and articulate institution that inspired trust and confidence on behalf of private sector partners, who were always willing to assume risks and benefits, especially since they are accustomed to risk taking in\ntheir business activities. Although the change of rules in relation to the area of intervention was not initially accepted, none of the project partners withdrew. In the same way, some felt that the project intervention strategy did not consider the business interests of the private sector. Most corporate partners showed there was not much interest to participate in specific topics such as HIV/AIDS and Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH), in some cases due to cultural factors or lack of knowledge or experience in handling these topics. \n\nRegarding relations with current governments, most of the stakeholders consulted stated that these were developed according to the level of confidence of the private sector with government officials and especially the health and education portfolios. With regard to best practices and significant changes, all stakeholders consulted recognized\nthe high value on the principle of leverage (2:1), although some would have liked this to be reduced to 1:1. The technical support received is also recognized, especially in the areas of management and accountability, the possibility of having a common agenda (thematic an \npriority areas), and the slight achievements in the transition from a strictly philanthropic approach to more strategic approach to the problems identified. With these and other elements, those interviewed agree to assign a high value to the idea of public-private partnerships, especially with regard to nationwide priority issues (common agenda), but aligned to public policy.\n\nAs for the factors of obstacles and challenges, most referred to the contents of Modification 15, especially with regard to the change in geographical area, the reduction of the budget and in the case of NGOs the obligation to become a corporate partner. As indicated in the\ndocument, this is because they prefer to intervene in their area of influence and business interests. The goal of a 2:1 leverage ratio presented a challenge throughout the project period. At the same time, those interviewed still point to the excessive bureaucracy (procedures and controls), but also recognize it as a great added value to their institutions. In this component, cultural factors are again noted as a challenge for the implementation of programs on issues such as sexual and reproductive health and HIV.\nOther challenges mentioned refer to the lack of coordination between USAID programs, lack of contact between implementing partners with businesses, RTI staff turnover, and little specialized technical support received in the areas of health and education, as well as poor\ncommunication, information and disclosure of the nature, objectives, strategies and successes of the project. With respect to sustainability, most stakeholders consulted noted, and highly appreciated, having had a reliable facilitating agency with local staff. Furthermore, success was found responding to the most sensitive social needs of Guatemala, as actors from various sectors were more eager to become involved. At the same time, CentraRSE, United Way and FUNDESA, should be considered as potential successors to the Project. In summary, a great contribution (added value) of the Project experience in its second phase\nin Guatemala is the following: to have been able to attract the attention and interest of the private sector to team in leveraging resources for investment in health and education This because on one hand, the ability to manage and present a portfolio with an agenda, topics,\nactors and strategic areas that formerly appeared in a scattered and disjointed manner ensured the strengthening of capabilities in the areas of management, administration and accountability. All this experience influences the private sector, which is experiencing an incipient change in mindset to move from a system based on philanthropy, to a strategic approach that guarantees a greater impact on issues affecting regions and disadvantaged populations in the country.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Addressing the relevance and consistency of the Project, those consulted believe that in a future similar experience, the component related to the strategic vision and sustainability of\ninterventions should be subject to a political agreement between donors, key stakeholders, society, and government. Similarly, the Project should continue to promote and strengthen Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), ensuring that the private sector goes beyond the area of influence (employees and geographical area of direct intervention) to invest in issues on the national level in other priority areas and outside its area of influence and business interests.\nFurthermore, it is suggested that the entity that fills the role of RTI in the future becomes a facilitator and integrator of priorities and priority interventions in health and education (targeted strategy), to allow the private sector to invest in health and education in ways that align with their particular interests. To accomplish this, a sufficiently representative governance structure is necessary that incorporates the political/strategic levels, actors of high national influence, and advisory committees to support implementation. Given these obstacles and challenges, most stakeholders recommend that the partner status be respected, to review and make more flexible instruments and processes, ensure\ncompliance with agreed upon timelines and a staff of specialists to support in priority areas to be defined. All this, coupled with an efficient communication, advocacy and outreach strategy, as well as strengthening the political-strategic level with the participation of other donors, civil society, government, the Academy and Thought Centers to improve vision and orientation interventions.\n\n\nFinally, when considering a future intervention with the public-private partnerships approach, respondents recommended that USAID partners maintain their political and strategic role, continuing the Project with some political and strategic innovations arising from this evaluation, maintaining the policy of not delivering funding to the government, and to develop \"added value\" in partners. They also suggest evaluating the possibility of\ntransferring the strategy or method of multi-sector alliances to one of three consortium mentioned. These consortium have greater potential to exercise that role and incorporate other donors and stakeholders in Guatemalan society, as well to include an M&E system to measure and disclose the performance and impact of projects, to define a strategy and to assign a person to manage the relationship between Civil Society, Public and Private Sectors.",

Facilitate flows of remittances to and from displaced persons\n2. Facilitate flows of remittances, to women in particular\n3. Contribute to recovery, resilience, and return\n4. Foster economic growth within and beyond displacement settings\n5. Empower displaced populations\n6. Improve the financial literacy of displaced populations\n7. Increase the security of displaced populations and those implementing humanitarian programmes\n8. Enhance the connectedness of displaced populations\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. MNOs need to identify additional gaps in networks and infrastructure in both current and future at-risk areas, and continue to promote the use of mobile money with individuals and businesses. This may involve examining disaster risk projections and recent trends in displacement patterns to identify where to enhance connectivity in the future. In particular, this will likely involve examining rural areas just outside high-risk towns that currently lack a strong network.\n2. MNOs should provide training for mobile money agents working specifically in displacement contexts to help them cope better with the pressures of liquidity and insecurity.\n3. GSMA could organise regular workshops to share lessons learnt by MNOs in the use of mobile money in displacement contexts.\n4. All mobile money stakeholders need to collaboratively strengthen calls for action to government to ease local regulations that block access to international mobile money transfers.",

      "Key Findings": "The combination of the large societal costs of a dense network of large dams and the lack of power access by the rural poor actually argues for a more widely distributed, lower impact network of power sources with lower cumulative and life cycle costs and greater benefits, especially to unserviced rural populations. The policy, regulatory, institutional capacity and infrastructure to support efficient national power grids are seriously deficient in the three poorest members of the LMS (Cambodia, Burma and Lao PDR), most well-developed in Thailand and partially developed in Vietnam. Lastly, solar PV and small hydro energy resources are the most ubiquitous and combined solar/small hydro projects could provide reliable electricity supplies for villages and small towns.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Power trading refers to large scale trades from surplus providers to markets where power demand exceeds local supplies. USAID could bring a comparative advantage of experience to the requirements for setting up trading between excess and deficient power producers or support initiatives being undertaken by other donors.\n\n- USAID could provide business development training for energy service companies ESCOs and work with the Funds to develop project appraisal, due diligence, and transparency measures, where required and support monitoring and evaluation of the Funds’ performance.\n- Continued support for the Asia Clean Energy Forum as an important knowledge exchange vehicle is a very cost effective way of building or supporting regional and broader international partnerships.",

      "Key Findings": "Over the lifespan of TB CARE I-Indonesia, the NTP, with support from GF, USAID and international partners, has made significant strides in expanding universal access to quality TB care in the public sector. There is almost full DOTS coverage at public health center (puskesmas) level, while substantial progress has been made in the engagement of general hospitals (hospital-DOTS linkages): the number of these hospitals implementing good quality DOTS expanded from 127 (2011) to 265 (2014) in TB CARE I-supported areas. The number of TB patients notified by these hospitals increased from 32,708 in 2010 to 54,004 in 2013.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1.a. Expand infection control in public and private sector facilities: Ensure the implementation of TB-IC measures, by including the FAST/TemPO strategy in infection control plans at all service levels, both primary and referral level health facilities, targeting all PMDT, DOTS and TB-ARV sites, prisons and detention centers in collaboration with DG Medical Service, and other related ministries and professional organizations such as PDPI, PERDALIN, etc.\n\n2.a. Expanding universal access to appropriate care and treatment\nProvide assistance to scale up coverage of quality TB care at all health facilities, notably those of private providers, in the following forms: Assist the NTP with further integration of TB services in the National Health Insurance (NHI) system and developing mechanisms to assure provider quality (through credentialing, certification, accreditation, evaluation and clinical audit).\n\n3.a. Strengthening political commitment and leadership\nChallenge TB should intensify efforts to support the NTP in strategic planning, management and operations, and securing commitment and sustainable financial support through national health insurance and local government/partners.",

      "Key Findings": "In developing countries like Pakistan, it is rather essential to have collaborated partnerships for accelerated economic growth. Insufficient capacity of the public sector to develop and provide essential services to the community is one aspect which accentuates private sector’s participation in such projects. Private sector’s sharing of obligations towards general public builds the spirit of community life, strengthens socio-economic fabric of the society and exhibits national character. Despite having wherewithal of a vibrant civil sector, Pakistan’s public management has not been able to exploit the potentials of their private partners. On the other hand, private enterprises have grown in capacity, knowhow on technology and management expertise of smaller to mega projects. Somehow public and private sectors in Pakistan have not been able to build comradeship for productive ventures.",
      "Key Recommendations": "What We Need to do in Pakistan? \n1)\tDeveloping Attitude\nHistorically Pakistan’s public sector has been aversive to private sector’s participation in development projects of the country. Under these environments of mistrust and deficit confidence, urgent need is to develop attitude of understanding, comprehending global realities, people’s requirement and obligatory commitments to fulfil them. \n2)\tOffice Management \nWhereas the world has moved to modern management techniques backed by technology, our office functioning especially of public sector is as sluggish as decades ago. \n3)\tCommunity Participation \nThere is a disconnect between society and government functionaries in terms of what public offices conceive and what are needs of common people. Resultantly even after completion, projects do not bring out desired economic and social benefits. \n4)\tPublic-Private Participation Instead of Privatization \nPrivatization has more negative implications than its positive outcomes. Therefore, it appears more appropriate to get engaged in public-private partnerships under varying terms and conditions. \n5)\tRisk Coverage and Security \nMega projects can be contracted in multi-stage commitments, each phase not exceeding 4 years. This is in-line with the government’s normal tenure. Any new government coming in, takes first year for planning. Thereafter before it winds up, the projects would have been completed. In this way, joint projects have more chances of success. \n6)\tRecognition in the Society \nDomestic investors in particular, feel encouraged once their projects are recognized in the society. Foreign investors also get international recognition of their projects being acknowledged by host country. Recognition does not cost money; it is only an attitude of appreciation. \n7)\tBuilding Models \nWe are a society of hero-seekers and model followers. Therefore, we need to create models and heroes in public sector development programs.\n8)\tDeveloping Construct of Public-Private Partnerships\nDue care is required to establish correct relationship between public and private sectors as well as consumers and private investor. Projects planned should have socio-economic relationship with end users.\n",

      "Document Title": "Strengthening Public Financial Management in Latin America and the Caribbean: Final Training Needs Assessment Report for Paraguay's Ministry of Hacienda",
      "Key Findings": "Qualitative data was collected and analyzed for trends, similarities and differences in stakeholders’ responses. Below are the key qualitative data findings, organized by stakeholder group for ease of\nreview:\n\n1.3.1 MANAGEMENT MEETINGS\n\nMH Budget and Public Investment Management Departments\n• Department of Budget (DGP) and Department of Public Investment (DSIP) senior management are overly committed to planning and budgeting reform, but often feel stretched thin with many\nsimultaneous and heavy job responsibilities.\n• DGP and DSIP management conveyed on the need to simplify and associate with other secondary legislation and regulatory framework in one organic budget law with a view to create an integrated financial management system that is clear within all its main wings and inter linkages.\n• Lack of a unified institutional framework and financial management structure that clearly establishes the main financial management functions and processes across the Government.\n• DGP personnel spend a disproportionate amount of time in processing of in-year budget adjustment requests from MDAs, often diverting them from technical matters such as monitoring and evaluation. Time resources could be used more efficiently if the administrative processes and procedures were simplified and automated.\n• Lacking of planning and budgeting manuals or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) specific to the needs of every MDA requires the DGP and DSIP personnel to spend substantive amount of time in providing lead advice and technical guidance to line management’s finance and administration officials.\n• There are limited training avenues for DGP and DSIP employees for such a broad spectrum of planning and budgeting competencies, and staff often does not understand their role in the overall PFM architecture.\n• Coordination with other relevant external stakeholders that serve the DGP and DSIP, (i.e., Civil Service, Public Procurement, Planning Secretariat), is a weakness.\n• There is limited availability of relevant data, such as fixed asset financial information for DGP and DSIP to make informed budget decisions.\n• Management welcome efforts to strengthen planning and budgeting capacities to make reforms sustainable.\n\nLine Ministry Management\n• Line Ministry management was not involved in the PFM Reform Action Plan 2012-2015 and as such the reform dialogue and sensitization with MH is weak. Moreover, communication pertaining to\nreforms and other relating events in budgeting and other PFM generally weak across Government.\n• Existing regulatory framework is very complex, and has grown hastily over the years, fragmented in various other pieces outside the Finance Administration Law (LAFE), thus resulting in data processing and exchange between processes and key units difficult, which often results in duplication of efforts.\n• Documentation of reform lessons, institutional record of training within most prolific Line Ministry is gone (i.e., Ministry of Public Works).\n• The roles and responsibilities of planning and budgeting functions are unclear, and often the communication between the different budget offices within the Line Ministries is limited to non-existent.\n• There is a serious disconnect between the various relevant directorate general units (i.e., Directorate General (DG) Finance and Administration, DG Public Purchases, DG Human Resources, DG Planning) and their respective subordinate cells, often creating duplication of tasks and staffing.\n• Line ministries often lack proper budget management tools and systems, resulting in routine work cumbersome and inefficient.\n• There is a culture of high staff turnover which limits the institutional record and documentation of reform lessons. Management is very concerned about the lack of institutional capacity that is retained\nin their organizations, particularly in budgeting. Due to high turnover, trained personnel do not stay on the job long enough to train other colleagues, or are very limited in number.\n\n1.3.2 HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT MEETINGS\n• The MH Human Resources Coordination Department is understaffed in accordance to international best practices.\n• Jobs are posted internally and externally on the Secretariat of Public Functions (SFP) website and the ministry websites. SFP manages the recruitment process with input from the ministries.\n• The MH and LM have a different protocol for conducting the annual TNA as well as preparation of their annual Training Plan. The MH Training Plan focuses heavily on sourcing external free training versus designing, developing and delivering internal training. The annual training budget varies from across MH and LMs.\n• Currently, MH and LM do not have a protocol for training, developing and promoting staff given concern over how to implement the Law of Public Servants. There is a protocol for how staff apply and get accepted for external training. However, it is different in each organization.\n• The MH and LM have a different protocols and forms for the annual review process. Not all employees complete their annual performance appraisal.\n• Compensation is based on title and the amount of education and training but pay scales vary by ministry.\n\n1.3.3 INSTRUCTOR MEETINGS\n\n• Potential MH instructors are qualified in their respective areas of management, instruction, technical expertise among other functions and competencies and have a solid understanding of their respective\nroles and responsibilities.\n• Many MH instructors also teach to supplement their full-time work in various MH units. None of the instructors went through a competitive selection to be an instructor. Instead, they were “nominated” because of their expertise and years of experience in budgeting and other relevant technical areas.\n• Instructors interviewed have worked or have strong experience as instructor in key fields considered critical and relevant to planning and budgeting such as the financial regulatory framework, financial planning and programming.\n• None of the MH instructors have experienced at a Training of Trainers (TOT) program but one had a positive learning in 2008 from one TOT program at Curitiba/Brazil with the aim of replicating the TOT experience in Paraguay, which never consummated.\n• All instructors felt that they would benefit from more training on how to effectively develop and deliver courses. Furthermore, all interviewed instructors indicated that they would like to become trainers to\nlearn more and teach on other fields relevant to their budgeting or planning job duties.\n• All instructors agreed they do not receive guidance on developing and delivering a course to training participants. Instead, instructors are supplied with generic training materials, (i.e., United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America - UN/CEPAL), core materials in monitoring and evaluation, not adapted to the specific sector-by-sector training needs.\n• All responded the existing regulatory framework and institutional bottlenecks being challenge factors to the strengthening of technical capacities within PFM in Paraguay.\n1.3.4 INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS\n\n• Budgeting trainings provided by International Development Partners (IDPs) are often one-off efforts that are project-focused and are not well coordinated.\n• IDP-funded budget reform efforts with associated trainings are particularly focused on project management and monitoring and  evaluation, often seen too advanced, and are not articulated with\nother relating training within MH.\n• Current technical assistance that is underway by the two IDPs is highly relevant to the PFM-LAC Project in Paraguay, and there is opportunity for establishing lines of coordination and collaboration.\n• The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) agreed with DGP in prioritizing and streamlining of core competencies of planning and budgeting to training plans.\n1.3.5 BUDGET COMPETENCY SURVEY\n\n• Common themes among MH and LM survey respondents included improving the budgeting legal framework, enacting participatory budgeting, grounding assumptions in realistic operating plans, and\nproviding various levels of training to all employees in budgeting competencies and processes.\n\n1.3.6 INSTITUTION CAPACITY SURVEY\n\nMH staff shared:• Their work is important because it is focused on the effective management of public funds and the ability to provide transparency in public administration.\n• The easiest part of their job was working with their team members.\n• Salaries were low and that a lack of career planning has led to low morale among employees and high turnover.\n• Desire additional training open to all employees in technical areas relevant to their jobs.\n• To improve their work environment, staff indicated that they would appreciate improved infrastructure, physical space, and IT software and systems.\n\n1.3.7 MH TRAINING COMMITTEE\n\n• A Training Committee exists within MH that has a protocol for how staff apply for external training opportunities. The Training Committee was established in 2010 with a Training Resolution Act. The protocol identifies the committee members and the criteria for participant training evaluation.\n\n1.3.8 TRAINING FACILITIES\n\n• None of the existing MH training facilities meet international best training practices. They are primarily designed for lectures instead of highly interactive adult training. Several rooms are of adequate size.\nHowever, there is insufficient space and tables for the participants to conduct exercises in workbooks or work in teams.\n• The National Public Administration Institute of Paraguay (INAPP) has a training facility that meets international best training practices. However, the rooms are small and can only accommodate around ten (10) to 20 participants. They also have a computer lab that can accommodate 18 participants. \n\nQuantitative data was collected and analyzed for trends, similarities and differences in stakeholder’s responses. Below are the key quantitative data findings, organized for ease of review:\n\n1.4.1 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY\n\n• Major weaknesses in planning and budgeting concentrate mainly in the key domains selected by the DGP for the Budget Competency Survey.\n• The outcomes of the TNA are consistent with the findings highlighted in the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment in that gaps in skills and competencies are high in the\ndomains considered as primal, such as financial planning, budget accounting and reporting, and leading practices in planning and budgeting.\n• MH has devised a medium-term reform strategy, the Public Financial Management Reform Action Plan (PFM RAP) 2012-2015, to improve planning and budgeting and sustain capacity development, in response to the latest PEFA assessment.\n\n1.4.2 BUDGET COMPETENCY SURVEY\n\n• 318 employees completed the survey of a population of approximately 419. This gives a confidence level of 99% with a margin of error of four (4). This means that the MH and LMs can be 99% confident that the results are within a 4% margin of error of what the MH and LM staff actually believe concerning their budget competencies and their importance. \n• The survey revealed that competencies across Domain #3: Financial Planning and Budgeting were the weakest areas across MH and the LMs in terms of importance and effectiveness. Competencies relating to understanding of the role of taxation and non-tax revenues in the financing of budgets were the lowest overall and below international leading practice.\n• Competencies across Domain #1: Legal and Institutional Arrangements for Budget Preparation were the strongest across MH and LMs in terms of importance and effectiveness. Respondents\ndemonstrated that they have an average to above average understanding of the budget process and its role in PFM.\n\n1.4.3 INSTITUTION CAPACITY SURVEY\n• 103 employees completed the survey of a population of approximately 131. This gives a confidence level of 99% with a margin of error of six (6). This means that the MH and LMs can be 99% confident that the results are within a 6% margin of error of what the MH staff actually believe about their work and workplace.\n• The lowest rated section of the Institution Capacity Survey is Management and Senior Management (24.23% gap) followed by Communications (22.53% gap). The three lowest rated questions are: fairly compensated (38.00% gap), MH values my work and contributions (31.62% gap) and team has regular meetings (28.33% gap).\n• MH management is not fully aware of their training and development role and responsibilities.\n\n1.4.4 HUMAN RESOURCES PRACTICES ASSESSMENT\n• MHs three (3) weakest human resources areas listed in priority order are: \n          1. Compensation          2. Appraisal, Development, and Career Planning\n           3. Training and Orientation.• This is consistent with the findings in the Institution Capacity Survey.\n• The MH training and development function is understaffed in accordance to international best practices.\n\n1.4.5 TRAINING PROVIDER EVALUATIONS\n• The MH and LM internal training providers (MH, MAG, MEC, MOPC AND MSPyBS) lack expertise in Instructional Systems Design (ISD) and application of the ADDIE Model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation) for needs assessment as well as course design, development, delivery and evaluation.\n• None of the MH and LM’s internal training providers meet international training standards. Both the qualitative and quantitative data surfaced very similar key findings validating the Training Needs\nAssessment findings documented in this report.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This section contains the recommendations to improve individual and organizational performance based\non the qualitative and quantitative data collected from the Training Needs Assessment as well as the\nconsiderations provided in the previous section:\n• Recommendation 1: MH should prioritize improving the budgeting legal framework, enacting\nparticipatory budgeting processes, promote mechanisms and tools that help to ground assumptions in\nrealistic operating plans, and provide training to all employees at all levels in the identified budgeting\ncompetencies and processes (Domain #3: Financial Planning and Budgeting).\n• Recommendation 2: MH should capture and clarify the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities\ninvolved in the budget preparation process along with providing clear job descriptions, and\ncomprehensive policies and procedures to guide the day-to-day tasks and expectations in budget\npreparation.\n• Recommendation 3: Learning Development Plans should be established as they are critical to the\nsustainability and effectiveness of MH and LM departments, divisions and units. Equal effort should\nbe given to providing coaching, mentoring and on-the-job training for all MH and LM staff to capitalize\non the reality that between 80% and 90% of all learning occurs outside of the classroom.\n• Recommendation 4: Consideration should be given to expanding existing MH’s Training Committee\nmandate (established in the 2010 Training Act) to include internal training so that it may serve as a\nTraining Advisory Board. The expanded Training Committee would be responsible for annually\ndetermining the courses that would be designed, developed, delivered and evaluated internally in\naccordance to a more robust Training Needs Assessment.\n• Recommendation 5: Courses proposed as part of this program should be sequenced by the Training\nAdvisory Board according to priorities and levels of skills proficiency and competency. All budget\npreparation courses should be performance-based and provide both theory and practice so that\nknowledge and skills, or competencies, are built and sustained.\n• Recommendation 6: The Training Advisory Board should evaluate the merits of appointing MH’s\nHead of Human Resources Department of Well Being and Training to be the MH Training Lead to\nsupport the implementation of the Sustainable Learning Transformation. This will foster capacity\nbuilding and long-term sustainability.\n• Recommendation 7: Training Departments within each Line Ministry should build and implement a\ncomprehensive Training of Trainer’s Program and require all employees engaged in staff training to\ntake and successfully pass the program. Successful completion would entail designing, developing\nand delivering programs in accordance to international best training standards.\n• Recommendation 8: Training Departments within the MH and the Line Ministries should be\nstrengthened so they can be less reliant on externally provided training. Building expertise in\nInstructional Systems Design and the application of the ADDIE Model to determine, design, develop,\ndeliver and evaluate training within these units is strongly recommended.\n• Recommendation 9: Any Training of Trainers Program should begin within MH and then be rolled-\nout to line ministries following similar training governance and instructor selection arrangements.\n• Recommendation 10: Strong consideration should be given to purchasing additional training related\nfurniture and equipment for the MH to provide a training room that meets international best training\npractices.\n• Recommendation 11: Existing budget instructors should be encouraged to apply for the Training of\nTrainers Program so that they can grouped according to their work, and academic specialization\nalong with the planning and budgeting competencies and fourteen technical courses proposed in this\nreport. This will allow them to design, develop and deliver performance-based courses that provide\ndocumented learning and high on-the-job retention.\n• Recommendation 12: MH needs to strengthen and appropriately staff several human resources\nfunctions to support the implementation of performance-based budget training listed in priority order:\no Training and Orientation\no Appraisal, Development and Career Planning\no Strategy, Planning, Policies and Communication\no Succession Planning.\n• Recommendation 13: A Standard Operations Procedure Manual for Training should be written that\nreflects a culture of accountability and transparency, characteristics that are integral to sustainability.\nThis manual should be a living document that is frequently referenced, well-communicated, and\nrevised.\n• Recommendation 14: The MH should provide training to all managers to promote a standardized\nlevel of managerial support. In addition, all managers should be trained to provide direct, clear and\ntimely communication with all staff.",

      "Key Findings": "This review includes a total of 53 programs that reported efforts to improve the nutritional status of adolescent girls and/or WRA in LMIC between 2004 and 2014. Priority nutrition practices have been promoted or delivered through a broad range of delivery platforms,\nstrategies, and activities which have been grouped into the following categories:\n\n• Community-based platforms for nutrition education and promotion\n• Mass media\n• Distribution of micronutrients, food, or cash\n• Capacity building of health workers (or other service delivery agents)\n• Capacity building of local organizations / governments\n• Policy/strategy/protocol development\n\nFigure 1 shows the frequency that each delivery strategy or activity was used by the programs reviewed. Capacity building of local organizations / governments (31 programs, 58 percent) and community-based platforms for nutrition education and promotion (28 programs, 53 percent) were used most often while distribution of\nmicronutrients, food, or cash (17 programs, 32 percent) and mass media (10 programs, 19 percent) were used least often. The nutrition practices targeted by the projects and programs studied were grouped as follows:\n\n• Improved eating practices4\n• Consumption of a diverse diet\n• Purchase/consumption of fortified foods\n• Intake of adequate amounts of water\n• Consumption/intake of IFA/iron\n• Consumption/intake of micronutrient supplements\n\nNone of the programs reported promoting rest during pregnancy.  Nutrition-sensitive practices were considered beyond the scope of this review. As illustrated in Figure 2, the most commonly promoted nutrition practices were described as improved eating practices (30 programs, 57 percent) followed by the intake of IFA/iron (20 programs, 38 percent), consumption of a diverse diet (14 programs, 26 percent), and purchase/consumption of fortified foods (11 programs, 21 percent). Few programs promoted the intake of micronutrient supplements (4 programs, 8 percent), intake of adequate amounts of water (2 programs, 4 percent), and the consumption of additional food (1 program, 2 percent) as a priority practice. Programs identified through the search are described in the sections below. Those programs that aimed to improve the nutritional status of more than one population of interest, and provided specific information for each targeted population, are described in each corresponding section.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on the synthesis of the literature findings and survey responses, the following policy-level\nrecommendations are made: 1) address nutrition of adolescent girls and WRA in policies, systems, and guidelines;\n2) define adolescence and bring attention to the specific nutritional needs of adolescent girls; 3) disaggregate\ndata by age and gender at the national level; 4) integrate nutrition guidelines into existing adolescent, maternal\nand child health, prevention of maternal to child transmission of HIV , and other guidelines that address services\nfor WRA; and; 5) streamline and collaborate at all levels. With respect to nutrition programming for adolescent\ngirls and WRA, the paper identified the following: 1) expand upon lessons learned from IFA programs; 2) consider\ninterventions to prevent and address risk factors for nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases (N-RNCDs); 3)\nidentify platforms to address the nutritional needs of women outside of pregnancy and lactation periods; 4)\ninvolve women and communities in nutritional program planning; 5) identify opportunities for multisectoral\ncollaborations and program integration; and, 6) address gender norms.",

In addition to helping millions of smallholder farmers improve their yields and incomes and\nhelping families—particularly mothers and young children—improve nutrition, new data show that our efforts are contributing to downward trends in poverty and malnutrition, Feed the Future’s two top goals. These results suggest that Feed the Future can meet its ambitious goal of reducing poverty and stunting by an average of 20 percent across the areas where the initiative works. While additional impact data are still being collected to measure changes in incomes and poverty, preliminary data indicate that Feed the Future programs, along with complementary U.S. Government and other donor activities, are building a strong foundation for continued economic growth and\nresilient communities.

Evidence on the links between regulation and inclusive growth is inconsistent. Some\nregulatory efforts have had positive social impacts, but the evidence base is limited. Many interventions focus on upgrading and sharing the gains from participating in global, regional and national value chains, including linking producers to high-value markets and improving working conditions. Evidence of the impact of interventions is limited by a lack of rigorous evaluations, but there are some case study examples of success. In terms of market development, they are particularly important for poor men and women, yet they are often costly or difficult to access. Interventions aim to increase access to markets by providing new technologies and technical assistance, and by brokering links between producers and buyers.",

      "Key Findings": "Ending malnutrition in all its forms will drive sustainable development forward. This point needs to be emphasized more strongly in efforts to achieve and monitor the Sustainable Development Goals. Although a great deal of progress is being made in reducing malnutrition, it is still too slow and too uneven, while some forms of malnutrition, namely adult overweight and obesity, are actually increasing. Concrete action to address malnutrition, backed by financing, is being scaled up—but not nearly enough to meet the 2025 World Health Assembly (WHA) targets or the SDG target of ending malnutrition in all its forms by 2030. Commitment to and financing for nutrition will need to be ramped up significantly if we are to meet these eminently reachable global targets. A virtuous cycle of improved nutrition and sustainable development can be unleashed if action to address malnutrition in all its forms can be embedded within key development sectors. The accountability of all nutrition stakeholders needs to improve if this virtuous circle between sustainable development and nutrition is to be fully realized. Significant reductions in malnutrition—in all its forms—are possible by 2030.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. MEET TARGETS ON NUTRITION OUTCOMES AND PRAC-\nTICES, AND DELIVER ON COMMITMENTS TO TAKE ACTION.\nCountries, aid donors, development agencies, compa-\nnies, and many others have made public commitments to combat malnutrition in recent years. It is time to\nmake good on these commitments.\n\n2. UNLEASH THE VIRTUOUS CIRCLE OF IMPROVED NUTRI-\nTION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. The forces that prevent good nutrition status are powerful and multi-\nsectoral, and they need to be counteracted by forces that are equally powerful and multisectoral.\n\n3. STRENGTHEN ACCOUNTABILITY IN NUTRITION. Our ability\nto hold duty bearers accountable for their commitments\nneeds to be strong. Strong accountability will give all\nstakeholders—existing and new—more confidence that\ntheir actions will have an impact, that bottlenecks to\nprogress will be identified and overcome, and that their\nsuccesses will inspire others.",

Take a holistic approach to developing a gender strategy: Identify the specific gender-related risks,\nresponsibilities and opportunities that the company faces throughout its business activities and areas of influence\n(core business operations; value chain; communities; and policy dialogue) and develop an overarching strategic\nplan that leverages all of the company’s assets to address these in a comprehensive and integrated manner.\n\n2. Embed the corporate responsibility to respect women’s rights into relevant policies and standards:\nAt a minimum, aim to ‘do no harm.’ Implement policies and undertake due diligence to identify, prevent,\nmitigate and remediate human rights risks and formal discrimination against women in the company’s\nbusiness operations and value chain.\n\n3. Establish goals, incentives and programs to actively promote women’s opportunities:\nAim explicitly to create shared value through actively empowering women. Identify a small number of priority\ngoals to increase women’s participation and progress at all levels of the company’s business operations, value\nchain, communities and policy dialogue and establish time-based targets, incentives and programs to drive\nperformance and culture change.\n\n4. Create cross-functional leadership structures and champions for women’s empowerment:\nToo often, gender is addressed in corporate silos. Human resources focuses on workplace inclusion and\ndiversity; procurement on supplier diversity; community relations on community initiatives, etc. While functional\nspecialization is needed, this limits synergies and shared learning between different parts of the business.\nCreate senior corporate-level or operational-level Women’s Leadership Councils and/or identify some of\nthe most respected female and male executives across the company to act as champions for women’s\nadvancement, both internally and externally.",

      "Document Title": "Not a panacea: private-sector engagement in adaptation and adaptation finance in developing countries",
      "Key Findings": "The role of the private sector in climate ﬁnance is increasingly emphasized in international political debates. Knowledge of private engagement in mitigating climate change and in more advanced economies is growing, but the evidence base for private-sector engagement in climate change adaptation in developing countries remains weak. Starting from the premise that the private sector’s role in adaptation is often inevitable and potentially signiﬁcant, this article ﬁrst analyses the potential of private-sector engagement in adaptation and adaptation ﬁnancing in developing countries by conceptualizing the private sector’s roles and motivation therein. For further inquiry, and for a discussion based on a developing-country context, interviews were conducted with key stakeholders for adaptation of Zambia’s agricultural sector, including on ways in which the government can incentivize private-sector engagement in adaptation. How much private-sector adaptation and adaptation ﬁnance can be identiﬁed depends on the interpretation of the concept of adaptation. Under a broad interpretation, the domestic private sector in particular can contribute substantially to adaptation, both directly and indirectly, through its investments and activities. However, the international private sector’s role in ﬁnancing adaptation should be analyzed under a strict interpretation of adaptation and appears limited.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Governments thus have to carefully design incentives for private-sector engagement in adaptation. This was outside the scope of this article, and private-sector awareness of adaptation might first need to grow further, but, in the future, a more extensive study on the impact and required policy framework for private-sector engagement in adaptation could really benefit adaptation processes in countries like Zambia.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Just as there is no single ideal health system, there is no single approach to HSS. Countries operate in different political, social, economic, cultural, demographic, and epidemiological contexts, from fragile states with weak economies to those with democratic governance and emerging economic growth. Broad political economy issues often drive health systems organization, priorities, and performance. That said, some commonly used process steps to design an HSS program, either stand-alone or integrated into a health service delivery project, are necessary to initiate country-based HSS strategic plans and activities. The critical first step is to conduct a health systems assessment. A health systems assessment includes a detailed examination of the health system environment as a foundation, along with an analysis of the six health systems functions, and includes a description of the private health sector. USAID’s The Health Systems Assessment Approach – A How-To Manual (2.0) is a key field resource. The health systems assessment typically is conducted with a team of internal USAID andexternal partners’ experts selected by the mission. \n\nA mission may use this Vision and its health systems assessment together to take the next steps to create comprehensive HSS programs. The Vision and health systems assessment may be used to: inform new project designs and re-designs in Project Approval Documents; make\ndecisions on priorities for limited financial resources; guide project work plans and activities and mid-term reviews; structure and complete Health Implementation Plans, HSS action plans, and other USAID reporting; create monitoring and evaluation plans, including the selection of key indicators; design and conduct baseline, mid-term, and\nend-line project evaluations; share with national governments to influence and advocate for them to adopt HSS strategies and policies; and engage in global dialogue with multilateral and bilateral partners, non-governmental organizations, and private sector to stress the need for strategic investments in HSS.\n\nEvidence on the extent to which interventions to strengthen and enhance health systems performance contribute to improvements in health status has been scarce, scattered and not widely disseminated. USAID and other partners have been challenged by a lack of a robust evidence base for investing scarce health funds in HSS interventions in\nan environment of competing investment options.\n\nTo enhance the basis for decision-making, GH commissioned a rapid review of systemic reviews to summarize and document the effects of HSS interventions on proxy measures for health status. The preliminary results of this rapid review identified thirteen HSS interventions that have demonstrated a positive effect on the following proxy health outcome measures: improved service provision/quality; increased financial protection; increased service utilization; uptake of healthy behaviors; and reduced morbidity and mortality.",

      "Key Findings": "Over the last year, the Global Development Lab has worked closely with our Agency partners to deliver the kind of game changing results that we have been so proud of throughout USAID’s 50 year history. In 2014, 47 USAID Missions and Bureaus used the Lab’s tools, approaches, and mechanisms to drive results, investing $54 million. In addition, 18 Missions and Bureaus actively collaborated with the Lab on the Agency’s priority STIP efforts, including integrating e-payments into Agency operations, scaling climate resilient maize, and supporting biodiversity conservation in the Brazilian Amazon. These partnerships will deepen in the coming year. The Lab also seeks to lead the development community on evidence-based decision making. In this first year, the Lab’s Office of Evaluation and Impact Assessment has ensured monitoring, evaluation, and learning practices reflect the Lab’s high expectations for the production and use of quality evidence for decision-making. \n\nThe Lab has set evidence standards in consultation with experts from academia, industry, and other actors in the development community to determine which innovations are ‘best bets’ for continued investment. Finally, the Lab is leading a collaboration with external partners to develop, and drive adoption of, innovative tools and methodologies in monitoring, evaluation, and learning that enable the Agency to rapidly and responsibly iterate and improve programming, and make the use of data and evidence in decision-making more feasible. As the Lab does its work to produce breakthrough development innovations, we look to work with all our partners to transform the U.S. development enterprise — all to reach the goal of accelerating an end to extreme poverty.",

      "Key Findings": "As highlighted in this report, USAID is engaging the private sector in increasingly diverse ways. As market-based solutions to development challenges gain prominence, the Agency and its partners are sharing best practices, and contributing to a growing field of knowledge of public-private partnerships that advance market-based solutions to\ndevelopment challenges. Additionally, partnering is becoming embedded across USAID, changing the Agency internally. USAID is investing in training to build the capacity of Agency staff around the world to work with the private sector, recruiting more people with  private sector experience and skills, and implementing more robust approaches to manage ongoing relationships with private sector partners.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It is a key Agency priority to make partnering more efficient and effective—reducing the transaction costs of building and maintaining public-private partnerships and accelerating their ability to realize progress. Together, all of those working at the intersection of business and global development must do a better job of measuring and understanding the impact of partnerships, replicating successes, and acknowledging and learning from failures and mistakes. The Agency will continue to pursue partnerships with local and global corporations,\nand boost investments in business-related reforms in partner countries around the world. This approach will accelerate the ability of the  Agency and its partners to deliver results, and to do so with greater efficiency and long-term sustainability.",

      "Key Findings": "Defining DoD’s role in using humanitarian health programs for security goals can and should be done. I propose such a definition, but only to begin discussion. Equally important is the implementation of scientific evaluation of humanitarian missions. This can be done quickly, without new authorization or appropriation legislation. Then DoD can get on with the business of national security, using the humanitarian response tool in the most effective ways. For DoD to avoid this “easier service” trap in its humanitarian efforts, we must be clear in our intentions, sustainable in our actions, and compulsively thorough in our evaluations. Together, even in the face of a tenuous link between health interventions and peace outcomes, DoD can deliver on its peace and security mandate to the taxpayers and the Congress",
      "Key Recommendations": "I believe there are potential solutions for the challenges of validating DoD’s engagement in humanitarian work for security objectives. There are two essential ingredients: DoD must first define exactly what it hopes to accomplish. Second, DoD should monitor and evaluate its efforts with greater rigor. ",

      "Key Findings": "Ultimately targeting 70,162 beneficiaries at the community, district and provincial levels, API Perubahan strengthened the capacity of local government officials, community members and informal leaders across\nten vulnerable sub-districts (kelurahan) among two provinces in Indonesia: Jawa Tengah and Maluku.\n\nIn these areas, API Perubahan established two Program Advisory Committees (PAC) that formed as the local forum at regency (Kabupaten) level that is concerned with disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation; and four sub-district working groups (SDWGs, or Pokja). The PAC engaged representatives from Kabupaten down to sub-district governments, academia and local NGOs. API Perubahan provided training in the areas of climate analysis; climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) for PAC and SDWG members utilizing the training curriculum and modules used by the National Disaster Management Agency (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana, BNPB) (which was improved by API Perubahan); training on advocacy and local development planning for SDWG; and entrepreneurship training for SDWG and community entrepreneur.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The excellent relationships and engagement with various stakeholders (national and provincial government, technical agencies, NGO, and private) that were built by API Perubahan should be maintained and strengthened by Mercy Corps Indonesia. Other DRR or CCA related projects under Mercy Corps Indonesia could incorporate their activities with engagement with these partners. In addition, SDWGs should clearly state their concrete action plans. Instruments and other knowledge management products should be better adapted to the local context. For the monitoring system, it is important to measure the program achievement by qualitative indicators. ",

It is also true that the economic and political clout received from their donor empowers NGOs to act against the governments of the countries in which they work.\n\nThis article has shown that in certain instances, NGOs, largely due to ideological and financial reasons, have adopted policies and strategies against national interests of the states in which they operate.

      "Document Title": "Performance Evaluation of the Staple Crops and Institutional Support Program Implemented by the West and Central African Council for Agricultural Research and Development (WECARD)",
      "Key Findings": "There was a general acknowledgement from the CORAF/WECARD Administration and Finance Department that capacities in the department were built and deployed for improved financial\nmanagement and operations of the department. Similarly, it was established that CORAF/WECARD’s human resources were strengthened under the GFSRI and FtF as demonstrated by increased staff numbers (5 paid from FtF funds) and capacity to manage programs, finances, knowledge and M&E (Annex A.1.C).\n\nOverall, the general consensus among beneficiaries and partners is that the USAID-funded IFSP was relevant and contributed to institutional strengthening at both CORAF and the NARS. Out of 9 end-user beneficiaries interviewed, 93% reported that they would be “very interested” in participating in a similar project in the future ((Appendix 5). At CORAF/WECARD, the two Program Managers funded by the IFSP strengthened the CORAF/WECARD Secretariat through their resource mobilization efforts that brought in an estimated $10 million in new project funds in 2011. (CORAF/WECARD Assessment Report, 2011). These new funds enabled the recruitment of additional staff for CORAF/WECARD programs. The scientific, coordinating and advocacy roles played by the Program Managers contributed to leveraging other agricultural and related research and/or development projects in the West Africa region funded by other donors. Examples of those donor-funded initiatives that used resources, outputs and knowledge from the SPS projects were the West Africa Agricultural Productivity (WAAP) and the Yam Improvement for Income and Food Security in West Africa, YIIFSWA, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nAt the country level, the project achieved most of its training targets. In Ghana a total of 274 farmers (12.4% females) were trained in the Minisett technology and another 300 (15% females) trained in the yam vine techniques. In Nigeria, Togo and Benin, beneficiaries trained in the Minisett totaled 1,400 (15.7% females), 485 and 170 (34.7% females). In Nigeria the trained farmers trained other farmers, about 3 fold in number. The overhead charges of 2.5% paid to participating NARS was considered too small by most NARS. Directors and some institutions felt that it had a negative impact on project implementation and end user-based Institutions like associations, organizations and NGOs acknowledged how much participation in the SPS projects strengthened their capacity. \n\nThe members of a union of cooperatives in Mali called the USCPCS, who participated in the Striga-Sorghum project credited their successes to capacity strengthening from the project. They celebrated the following exceptional results: nearly 90% of the members of the USCPCS group used improved varieties of sorghum during 2013/14 season, and increased the yield of sorghum from 700 kg/ha (local varieties sorghum) to about 2500 kg / ha (improved varieties) and household income multiplied 5 fold between 2009/2010 and 2013/2014.",
      "Key Recommendations": "CORAF/WECARD should consider shortening the STC processes for project reviews, approvals and validation. They should also adapt flexible procedures and steps to accommodate situations where time\nis of the essence.\n\nUSAID and CORAF/WECARD should consider making adequate budget\nallocations that cater for effective field level project implementation and monitoring required by NARS institutions targeted to participate in the upcoming Feed the Future projects.\n\nThe evaluation team recommends that CORAF/WECARD honors previous agreements made in Memoranda of Agreement with NARS regarding payments of overheads. The evaluation team recommends that CORAF/WECARD makes budget provisions that will allow the\npayment of at least a 10% overhead to NARS institutions implementing USAID-funded projects.\n\nCORAF/WECARD should better articulate the definitions of indicators and targets in their M&E frameworks and ensure NARS are familiar with the elements of the Log frames, including the methodology for  establishing credible baselines. CORAF/WECARD should organize a series of training courses for the M&E staff of the NARS. The training courses should include current and prospective project coordinators.\n\nCORAF/WECARD should standardize report formats for various categories projects. . These standardized formats should be shared and used by the NARS that are participating in the project.\n",

The framework proposes three dimensions: sector types (public, business and community), partnership arrangements (legislated and formal to\ninformal agreements), and partnership roles (strategic and resilience-building and response and recovery). This paper describes how the three sectors can work together under various partnership arrangements for preventive or responsive measures in emergency and disaster management. Public–private partnerships during and after the Queensland floods of 2010–11 are used to illustrate the relationships presented in the framework and to give a snapshot of these partnerships\nin Queensland.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Further research is needed across Australia to identify and describe public-private partnerships for emergency management, particularly at the local level where they have not been well-documented and may be underpinned by relatively informal agreements of unknown efficacy.

      "Document Title": "Waste Management Technologies in Regions, Georgia: Municipal Waste Management Plan Development Guideline",
      "Key Findings": "The recommended process for planning and implementing an effective MWM system may be categorized into the six phases illustrated in Figure 1 which presents both the anticipated functions and activities that a municipality should undertake in developing its MWM plans. \n\n• The Planning Preparation Phase: This is the initial planning function that should be that is aimed at defining and mobilizing the resources necessary for the municipality’s comprehensive planning effort.\n\n• The Existing Conditions Status Phase: This is the planning function intended to define current baseline conditions by assessing a municipality’s existing MWM system and all of the factors that influence its function and deficiencies.\n\n• The Options Assessment Phase: Once a municipality’s existing MWM system has been accurately and thoroughly defined, viable alternatives (technical, institutional, financial, etc.) to overcoming existing system deficiencies and meeting requirements of the Law “Waste Management Code” must be evaluated to determine which of the options available for the various system elements are in the best interest of the\nmunicipality. This option’s assessment phase provides the basis for establishing the WM action plan that will be the foundation of the municipality’s implementation strategy for planned improvements.\n\n• The Plan Adoption Phase ‐ Once existing MWM conditions in the municipality have been defined and viable options to overcome existing deficiencies have been identified, assessed, and selected, the MWM Plan and its implementation strategy should be formally  adopted by municipal elected officials and approved by national\nregulatory officials responsible for assuring that the MWM Plan and its\nrecommendations comply with the requirements of the “Waste Management Code”.\n\n• The Implementation Phase: After the formal adoption of the municipality’s MWM plan, the implementation of the plan’s target outcomes can occur which may include the development of policy, financial/economic, institutional, and technical instruments that are to improve the MWM system as well as implementing the physical processes and facilities necessary to achieve result.\n\n• The Monitoring & Review Phase: Once all or some of the target results of the plan have been implemented, the function of the resulting MWM system (or its individual components) must be closely monitored to assure that the plan results are sustainable and remain effective over time. In addition, the municipality should also recognize that a  successful planning process is dynamic and ongoing and requires\nperiodic review to update the plan in accordance with evolving conditions and what has been accomplished since the adoption of the initial MWM plan. (The Law “Waste Management Code” stipulates that the MWM plans should be developed for a 5 year planning term. This will establish the need to review the accomplishments of the municipality after five years and update the Plan to continue progress in accomplishing the municipality’s MWM objectives as well as the long term objectives of the “Waste Management Code”.)",
      "Key Recommendations": "Preparing to Develop the Plan \n1. Delegate responsibility for developing the SWM Plan\n2. Identify and secure the resources necessary to develop the plan\n3. Identify and initially engage relevant stakeholders\n4. Establish local stakeholder consultative group\n5. Define municipal waste management planning objectives and target outcomes\n6.

Lastly, industry level platforms are necessary to form and sustain partnerships.\n\n• Partnership outcomes\nPPP positively impact economic growth at the industry level and economic gains at the industry level do not lead to producer household-level economic benefits on their own. For development agencies to leverage poverty reduction outcomes of PPPs, they need to build innovation response capacity and bargaining power of smallholders vis-à-vis large buyers in concentrated markets.

      "Document Title": "From Transparency to  Accountability? Assessing How International Multi-stakeholder Initiatives are Contributing to  Public Governance",
      "Key Findings": "The links in the chain that connect information disclosure to public accountability are still uncertain. \n\nThis report finds that in many countries, governance-oriented MSIs have indeed managed to get traction with their promotion of public information disclosure reforms—in other words, more information is often available to the public, in part thanks to these initiatives. But there is little evidence as yet that these transparency outputs lead to accountability outcomes – at least so far. It turns out that the theories of change that connect transparency to accountability in governance MSIs  involve many more links in the chain than were originally envisioned.\n\nThe available research documents both the progress and limits of MSI-driven information disclosure, but more studies are needed to explain whether and how this progress drives tangible improvements in accountability. Several bottlenecks seem to be especially relevant:\n\nIn practice, government commitment to these MSIs is often weak or inconsistent. Governmental sign-on to MSIs may or may not indicate that commitment to open governance is shared across the state apparatus. Indeed, insider governmental advocates of openness often lack leverage over the rest of their governments – which is precisely why they might need (inter)national coalitions to give them a boost (as spelled out in OGP’s strategic plan, for example). Yet the closing of civic space in some MSI countries raises questions about the “net accountability effect” of their affiliation. In those difficult contexts, when does implicit MSI ‘certification’ bolster beleaguered reformists and keep doors open a crack, and when does it serve more to provide cover for fundamentally undemocratic regimes (i.e. openwashing)?\nGovernmental accountability institutions may be too weak or captured to act based on relevant information disclosures. After all, nation-states are composed of many moving parts, and the branches in charge of dealing with information disclosure often have little to do with those responsible for the rule of law. Consider the recent 2015 Open Budget Index: the Mexican government was given high marks for its now well-established information disclosure institutions, yet at the same time, even when high-level conflicts of interest (such as transactions between the president’s family and government contractors) are revealed to the public, the state’s accountability institutions turn out to have their own conflicts of interest and decline to act.\nIt’s hard to translate open data into actionable information. While more open data holds great promise, “infomediaries” (civic information processors) are still learning how to transform data that is often technical, aggregate, and/or abstract into information that is actionable for allies who have the civic muscle necessary to influence the powers that be.\nMSIs are bargaining processes where CSO technical sophistication is key, but expertise is no substitute for political clout. CSOs engaged with MSIs tend to be specialized, technical organizations rather than broad-based organizations with reach outside professional classes in the national capital. In some countries, moreover, CSOs engaged with MSIs are seen as lacking autonomy from their governments. These issues limit CSO participants’ political clout and their claim to represent civil society more broadly. For MSIs to sustain reform momentum, they need to “broaden their base” within national civil societies.",
      "Key Recommendations": "So how do we open up these bottlenecks? One key place to look for the coalitions and strategies necessary to do so is at the national level. Some MSIs seek to build national-level multi-sectoral coalitions that can exercise the civic muscle needed to really embed new norms and standards into national institutions. This process of forming national multi-stakeholder groups has gone the furthest in EITI and OGP, though only a minority function well. For example, in EITI, while some countries that are not certified have functioning MSGs, other countries that are certified have weak or unrepresentative MSGs.  In OGP, according to civil society liaison coordinator Paul Maassen, “How solid the coordination within civil society is at country level is more difficult to understand. There seems to be some sort of coordination in at least 2/3 of participating countries, with active coalitions in about 15-25% of the countries.” Another promising approach to broadening and deepening the constituencies for MSIs involves the involvement of subnational governments, as EITI is doing in Peru and the Philippines.",

      "Key Findings": "Development organizations rely on a number of different strategies to facilitate farmers’ awareness of, access to and ultimately adoption of improved production and marketing practices; to promote inclusivity; and to ensure program sustainability. The study revealed definitive trends in their approaches and methodologies. Most of the interviewed organizations (1) establish farmer field schools and demonstration plots, (2) build capacity of lead farmers and rely on them to foster continued knowledge exchanges, and (3) provide farmers with credit mechanisms and increase their access to markets, particularly through the use of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs). Another strong trend suggests that development organizations strive to ensure program sustainability by engaging the private-for-profit sector and building local capacities. Finally, our findings suggest that organizations attempt to mainstream gender issues, include participatory \nplanning in project design, and pursue participatory monitoring and evaluation strategies throughout the project cycle, though implementing participatory approaches can be a challenge. During the interviews the organizations shared some particularly successful approaches and strategies that have helped them in pursuing their objectives, but also discussed implementation challenges.",

      "Document Title": "West Africa Private Health Sector: Six Macro-Level Assessments",
      "Key Findings": "While the region is extremely diverse, the six countries share a strong pronatalist stance and account for some of the highest birth rates in the\nworld. Regional themes that emerged from the assessments and that shape the private health sector include the following:\n\n• Health expenditures\nOut-of-pocket spending represents more than 75 percent of private\nexpenditures in all six countries. Scope of the private sector. Data show the large extent of the private health sector in West Africa. In Cameroon and Côte d’Ivoire, for example, private facilities represent 44 and 52% of all health facilities, respectively. The informal sector is thriving in all six countries, but, beyond anecdotal information, the data are limited. In addition, the six focus countries are at the bottom of the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report (2014).\n\n• Enabling environment for private health sector.\nThe six countries demonstrate weak enforcement of laws regarding noncompliant private health facilities; lack of incentives to develop private health facilities in rural areas; outdated, inadequate, and lax enforcement of inspection standards; and poor private sector reporting, including disease surveillance. Where fora (platform in French) for a public-private dialogue interaction exist, they do not meet regularly and may not include the for-profit health sector. The two exceptions are Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. HIV and family planning product and service provision. The private sector varies as a major source of family planning methods, responding to the needs of just 5.4 % of Nigerians and to more than 50 % of residents of Togo, Côte d’Ivoire, and Cameroon. Free or subsidized provision of many family planning and HIV products limits the private sector’s incentive to offer such\nproducts. Private provision of HIV and AIDS services varies by country, by type of service, and by private provider category, but, in general, the\nfor-profit sector is marginally involved. However, the nonprofit sector is much more involved in HIV and AIDS treatment, delivering 45% of all ART treatment in Togo and maintaining 65 treatment sites in Côte d’Ivoire. Private providers in all six countries expressed an interest in expanding the provision o family planning and HIV services, provided that a clear regulatory environment legally allows them to charge a fair price for service delivery.\n\n• Corporate social responsibility. \nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is not well developed in the region. It is largely limited to oil and mining companies as well as to large-scale agricultural and brewery conglomerates that focus more on HIV than on family planning. Within each of the six countries, CSR organizations and business coalitions can help USAID navigate the CSR landscape and develop connections with companies interested in forging health partnerships.\n\n• Public-private partnerships. The region accountsfor a low number of public-private partnerships (PPPs) as compared with other regions such as East Africa. Among the six countries, most PPPs focus on service contracts with NGOs tied to the community-based distribution of HIV and family planning products and services.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The six West African countries represent considerable diversity in terms of economic and social development, unmet family planning and reproductive health need, level of HIV delivery in the private sector, and market maturity. Yet, the countries share characteristics unique to the region, particularly with respect to reproductive behavior, private sector growth, and health sector reforms. Drawing on interviews with key stakeholders as well as on Internet research, the assessment team developed regional and country-specific recommendations, as presented below.\n\nRegional Recommendations\n• Improve the public-private landscape across the region through ministry of health collaboration with WAHO as catalyst, convener, and connector. Ministries of health in each country are important drivers of public-private collaboration and set the tone for partnerships. In collaboration with WAHO, they could develop a regional private sector alliance to advocate for the development of standards across West Africa for private sector engagement, reporting, and disease surveillance. Each country, in turn, could develop its national private health sector strategy to increase the private sector’s role in health care delivery. \n\n• Develop total market approaches to family planning by relying on contraceptive security committees.  Currently, WAHO is involved in a total market approach for contraceptive procurement, yet government stakeholders interviewed for the assessment demonstrated little understanding of or voiced no interest in pursuing a total market approach. USAID/West Africa projects could work with WAHO and the contraceptive security committees in the six countries to conduct national market segmentation exercises and ensure involvement of the for-profit health sector with each country’s contraceptive security committee. \n\n• Increase access to family planning services through collaboration with affiliates in focus countries. Collaboration with private provider networks that include social franchises and clinic outreach programs, such as Marie Stopes International, International Planned Parenthood Association, and Population Services International, offer the most direct way to increase access to family planning methods in rural and urban areas. Building on existing programs can help leverage scarce family planning resources while attaining economies of scale. \n\n• Increase corporate social responsibility opportunities within countries and across the region. The CSR landscape has undergone significant change, and multinationals are more selective and less willing to engage in CSR activities unrelated to their core business. In each country, it is important to reach companies through CSR associations and business councils in order to preselect companies interested in HIV- and family planning-focused partnerships. \n\n• Develop public-private partnerships with mining companies in West Africa. While mining companies in the region are smaller than those in other parts of Africa, they offer the best opportunity for health-related PPPs among multinationals in the region. These companies could integrate family planning services into existing HIV-related activities at their workplaces.\n\n• Increase learning within the region. Stakeholders interviewed in each country expressed interest in learning more about both unauthorized\nhealth facilities and illegal drug sellers. Research documenting the scale and scope of the informal sector’s involvement in service provision and\ndelivery of health products would be a first step in determining how to improve the sector’s role in the provision of high quality family planning and HIV services. The development of a regional private sector alliance requires a regional mechanism for the sharing of information and experience through an online community of practice. Examination and documentation of successful public-private initiatives can also help move West African countries toward stronger private sector  engagement in health. West African countries are increasing their attention on PPP infrastructure, with some countries passing laws to encourage companies’ investment. Nonetheless, the countries need assistance in moving from partnerships focused on infrastructure\nto those focused on health.",

Other programs, like the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) Sustainable Energy Facility (SEF), target commercial banks and provide technical assistance and finance. PFAN is focused on providing services to the project developer community to facilitate and increase CE investment.\n\nPFAN is expected to meet or exceed all performance targets and compares favorably with similar projects and programs designed to address barriers to CE investment. To date, 49 projects are estimated to have reached financial closure, meaning they have been matched with and funded by a financial institution, raising a total of $561.5 million.",
      "Key Recommendations": "USAID should consider funding expanded PFAN data collection and monitoring and evaluation. This would allow PFAN to develop an appropriate performance monitoring plan, collect data including during\nclosure proper, conduct routine exit surveys, and evaluate key areas of difficulty including procedures.\n\nAssuming both of PFAN's dual objectives of broadening access and increasing projects financed in the developing context remain relevant, USAID may wish to consider revising or adding indicators in the future that focus on broadening access.\n\nPFAN should consider first addressing the remaining barriers within the clean energy business area such as addressing negotiations and assistance for financial closure to reduce time to closure and improve\nreliability of data.",

      "Document Title": "Rwanda Health Private Sector Engagement Assessment",
      "Key Findings": "The findings of the case study can be divided into these categories:\n\n•Leadership & Advocacy\nThere is strong leadership and political will at senior levels, which is a critical success factor for PSE. The level of understanding/support for PSE varies within the GOR but there is a lack of systems and knowledge about how to engage the private sector, especially to develop PPPs. On top of this, effective coordination and clarity of roles and responsibilities between key stakeholders, such as the MOH, Rwanda Development Board (RDB), and RBC, is lacking and thus, limiting effective PSE. There is a lack of adequate capacity within the MOH, RDB, and RBC for effective PSE and PPP development and only limited dialogue and no formal platforms and systems for public and private engagement.\n\n• Policy and Planning\nThe overall tax and investment environment in Rwanda is favorable for private sector development (please see Annex B of the full assessment report for more discussion).  A new PPP legal framework has been approved (not disseminated) and the MOH, RBC, and RDB all have units or positions designed to engage the private health sector. Health-specific incentives in the tax and investment code are lacking, the implementation of PSE policies and plans is slow and PPP mechanisms and PSE/PPP planning process are not finalized. There are inadequate resources for effective PSE and PPP development and national- and district-level managers lack adequate skills and business know-how to implement PSE and PPPs.\n\nThe private sector and other key stakeholders are not adequately engaged in policy development and planning and there is limited communication and confidence between the public and private sectors. Current GOR tariff structure and complex regulations (e.g. procurement, licensing, and customs) can impede PSE. The new electronic single window system may facilitate trade by speeding up and simplifying information flows while there are opportunities to increase revenue collections on the importation and registration of new pharmaceutical products. Most private sector associations have limited organizational capacity while most hospitals lack autonomy, which creates  accountability, management, and efficiency issues.\n\n• Investment and Access to Finance \nThere is currently some financing for the private health sector. Loan terms (collateral requirements, interest rates, borrower contributions) and lack of start-up capital restrict borrowing. There is low domestic and foreign investment in the health sector and is compounded by the fact that the RDB has limited knowledge of the health sector and  institutional capacity to increase investment in this sector. Limited business skills in the health sector prevent increased access to finance and investment.\n\n• Corporate Social Responsibility\nThere are some examples of CSR (including PPPs) for the health sector in Rwanda, including GlaxoSmithKline’s support for One Family Health and Bralirwa’s funding for the local manufacturing of mosquito nets and workplace programming. Currently, most CSR funding is in the agricultural and information, communication, and technology (ICT) sectors by multinational companies mainly due to GOR-, DP-led investment promotion activities. There is low domestic and foreign investment in the health sector.\n\n• Health Subsector\nService Delivery: The private health sector is interested in expanding and partnering with the public sector and some public facilities are actively exploring PPPs. The private service delivery sector is small and fragmented but there is an opportunity to develop a sustainable private health post model and significant interest to increase PPPs and other income-generation strategies within facilities. There is no clear process and legal framework, and limited capacit to develop and implement PPPs.  “Business culture” and business skills are limited at the facility level. There is an interest and opportunity to strengthen and promote\nspecialized services and tertiary care in the private sector\n\nHealth Financing: Rwanda has made substantial progress towards universal coverage, overcoming financial barriers and improving equity. The private service delivery sector is small and fragmented and the integration of CBHI under the RSSB poses an opportunity for improved operational, financial, and management efficiencies. A high dependency on donor funding, which is declining, and the low purchasing power of the population is creating stress. The current GOR tariff is low, deterring private sector investment. A costing exercise has been completed to revise the GOR tariff structure, which is now awaiting approval. CBHI claim processing and payment inefficiencies and delays negatively impact private HPs. Opportunities exist to better integrate private  insurance into the health financing system. Most community health worker (CHW) cooperatives operate income-generation activities  (although low-profit), and income generation at the DH level is limited. There is interest in expanding income generation and improving efficiencies, but DH managers lack the skills and mindset.\n\nHRH\nThe lack of skilled health care workers is a constraint to PSE, to the development of specialized private health services, and to the privatization of medical equipment maintenance. The GOR is aware of the HRH problem and has a long-term vision and plan in place for  developing a skilled workforce. Retention is a major issue, particularly in rural areas.\n\nMedical Products\nThere is an active private pharmaceutical sector and a relatively\nactive private pharmacy sector. There are plans to strengthen  biomedical engineering skills, and the GOR is creating a Center of Excellence for biomedical engineering that will serve as an East African regional resource. There is insufficient funding and planning for medical equipment maintenance and management, and a culture of  replacement rather than repair due to donor dependency. There is a lack of skilled biomedical engineers and technicians. There are complex procurement and customs requirements for medical equipment and spare parts. There is almost no local medical product/equipment manufacturing.\n\nHIS\nThe GOR has made significant strides in e-health but there are\nmore opportunities to increase efficiencies through increased use of technology and PSE. There is increased use of DHIS2 with a high reporting rate and limited existing initiatives of private sector engagement in health information and mobile technology (e.g. RapidSMS). There are weak basic computer and IT skills at various levels. There is inefficient institutional capacity and systems, and high cost of basic IT and help desk operation. The high cost of Internet, including high set-up and operational costs for infrastructure, unstable electricity, and lack of resources, makes operations quite costly.\n\nHPP\nOutreach and demand-creation activities can improve the viability of\nsmall-scale private providers. PPPs related to HPP are working well, but there is significant room to improve and expand. There is an increased number of registered CHWs with high commitment to HPP work. There has been limited corporate engagement related HPP/CSR. New training programs are being developed for community health technicians on noncommunicable diseases in collaboration with the Workforce Development Authority. There are inadequate resources and access to HPP trainings.\n\nLKMThere are a number of existing PPPs geared towards training\nfacilitation, education, and knowledge transfer but there is limited knowledge within the GOR about health PPPs/PSE, no central database on the private sector, and no evidence base. There is also low clinical and operational research capacity (public and private), and inadequate PS involvement.",

The report also notes that M&E Plan data indicates FBP met its targets for data and number of reports shared with government and partners, and for the percentage of facilities and distribution outlets collecting and reporting data to FBP. Yet FBP underperformed on the number of health facilities handed over to government. Also, there has been no emphasis on counseling for dietary diversification or increasing micronutrient intake using the locally available sources. To conclude, we found no evidence that gender-related issues were examined, flagged or tracked over time. \n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Sustain and Scale-up: Based on the successes evidenced in this evaluation, USAID should continue to support the scale-up and integration with other nutritional outreach efforts, while working with the GOE to explore other options for subsidizing supplemental foods. The ES component lacks sufficient evidence of effectiveness to be scaled-up.\n\nWork jointly to assure routine nutrition assessment and counseling: The FMoH and HAPCO should work closely with RHBs, USAID’s Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance (USAID/FANTA III), World Food Programme (WFP) and other stakeholders working in nutrition and HIV/AIDS, to ensure that all health facilities routinely carry out nutritional assessment and counseling. \n\nInclude NACS in ART training: USAID and FMoH should assure the inclusion of NACS into the standard ART training, with appropriate indicators to ensure that every health worker trained on ART is also trained on NACS. Over the long-term, the FMoH, HAPCO, and USAID/FANTA III need to consider integration of NACS into the pre-service curriculum of health science colleges and medical schools.\n",

      "Key Findings": "Kenya needs to create more than 3.9 million new jobs for young people by 2020. According to recent estimates, over 1.5 million people are unemployed in Kenya, and over a third of them are young people between the ages of 15 and 24. In addition, Kenya’s workforce is projected to grow by 3.4 million people between 2014 and 2020, due primarily to new young adults entering the job market. Scaleups are some of the largest job creators in Kenya and can help to reduce youth unemployment. A 2013 World Bank survey found that only 5 percent of Kenyan companies were scaleups, but these companies created 72 percent of all new jobs generated during the previous three years. Furthermore, these scaleups need access to markets, talent, and funding in order to succeed. According to a survey of more than 1,000 entrepreneurial leaders from around the world, these three factors are the most important contributors to a firm’s growth and success. Contrary to the prevailing wisdom among many policymakers, respondents did not mention other factors such as regulatory frameworks or low taxes.\n",

      "Key Findings": "1. DIALOGUE was praised by all stakeholders interviewed by the ET for changing and creating a more positive environment for local governments. DIALOGUE’s templates and website designs have helped several local governments conduct opinion polls and surveys, and share budget information and performance indicators on the city website. \n\n2. Dialogue Day was consistently cited as being the most effective strategy for establishing working relationships with state officials, primarily with the Cabinet of Ministers and relevant state agencies.\n\n3. Both DIALOGUE and KIs in other development assistance programs mentioned using each other’s website to showcase their own work and best practices, and to include links to their own projects; case studies and lessons learned are also presented in each other’s workshops and seminars.\n\n4. DIALOGUE has promoted principles of transparency and openness among local governments by encouraging member cities to have a website to provide information on the budget, mayor’s policy initiatives, and other pertinent information, and providing website templates for smaller member cities and villages.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Legislative drafting should be continued and strengthened, as many new laws and by-laws would need to be prepared and cleared through the Cabinet of Ministers and the\nParliament.\n\n2. Continue support to hold Dialogue Day with Government of Ukraine (GoU). Also consider organizing and holding them on a more frequent basis, such as twice a year or as needed. Explore organizing and holding a Dialogue Day with Parliament, as part of the annual AUC municipal conventions (this is already scheduled for 2015).\n\n3. Similar to a donor coordination meeting, a quarterly or semi-annual meeting of donor funded projects could be very useful in sharing lessons learned and creating synergies for\ngreater collaboration. Keeping an active and updated record of past success stories and achievements can also help in quickly getting access to past analytical studies/guides and\nupdating them rather than having to “reinvent the wheel.”\n\n4. Increasing public support for local government reform is one of DIALOGUE’s objectives. However, the project has not chosen – at least thus far - to achieve this objective by\nencouraging and assisting local governments to focus on improvements in service delivery. Citizens’ support and trust in their government usually flows from the ability of the\ngovernment to be responsive to citizen’s needs and priorities. A focus on concrete, achievable results and service improvements within the budget, based on citizen feedback is\nan important step to achieve public support for reform.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Capacity-building approaches: As noted by several informants from the central and county levels, and recommended by the evaluation team, all capacity-building activities require: (a) clear, specific and time-bound objectives, and if technical assistance, terms of reference; (b) technical advisors, trainers or coaches with expertise, relevant experience and skills in knowledge transfer and teaming; (c) clear benchmarks; and (d) careful monitoring of performance by the project/donor.\n\nDeconcentration/Decentralization: Supporting accelerated  deconcentration of management of essential health care services and public health functions from the MOHSW to county and district health teams will require a systems approach, strengthening MOHSW functions and skills of personnel to carry out their oversight role and monitoring responsibilities while supporting county government as it assumes increasing responsibilities.\n\nEbola Response: The Ebola crisis has brought to the forefront the need for much stronger disease (and injury) prevention and control. It is recommended that USAID work in partnership with other key\ninternational agencies to provide technical assistance and capacity-building to develop a Public Health Service, within which community health, social mobilization, environmental health and health promotion functions are contained in addition to disease surveillance and outbreak/epidemic management to carry out the essential governmental public health services.",

      "Key Findings": "As agreed upon with USAID/Uganda, the team prioritized review of specific topics related to OVC programming in Uganda including systems strengthening, child protection, targeting and enrollment,\ngraduation and coordination with care and treatment partners. A rapid analysis of the existing USAID OVC Strategy for Uganda was also included as part of the portfolio review. These findings are informed\nby the desk review, key informant interviews and an understanding of the current context, both nationally and globally, regarding OVC programming priorities. In general, the team found the existing strategy to be comprehensive, reflect global and national priorities related to OVC and was evidence based with minimal need to change or adapt the existing strategy or approach.\n\n• Social Service Systems and Child Protection Capacity\nStrengthening the social service system requires understanding and addressing (1) the unique and mandated role of government to oversee, coordinate and manage the system to ensure that interventions are sustainable; (2) the active and planned engagement of civil society to support government, especially in the provision of social services; and (3) the need to develop or strengthen a range of interventions aimed at coordinating and strengthening the different components that make up the system. Given that the systems  strengthening approach is relatively new within the OVC sector, it was not surprising that there was significant variance in OVC implementing partners’ understanding of the approach and the role of government, as well as what is meant by terms such as ‘child protection.’ \n\nThese differences in understanding were particularly acute among non-OVC focused implementing partners that have OVC among their target populations, but not as their primary mandate. The USAID Mission in Uganda is in a unique position to support the transition to a more standardized approach and understanding by all OVC implementing partners of both the systems strengthening approach and the importance of child protection. If USAID continues to integrate OVC funds into larger non-OVC projects, then it may be worthwhile for project management of these projects to participate in a one-day management level orientation to social services strengthening and child protection based on the Makerere University Child Protection Training outlined in this report. This workshop would help implementing partners to adopt standardized terminology and a shared understanding of key concepts, building the foundation for improved coordination across the OVC response, and strengthening linkages\nwith the government social welfare system.\n\n• Targeting and Enrollment\nTargeting and enrollment are the processes used to identify and enroll households and children that will be served by a specific project or intervention. The USAID Mission has identified the most HIV affected areas of Uganda as geographic targets for their OVC programming, but each implementing partner uses different approaches and tools to identify beneficiaries. For example, one approach was a community mapping by district social welfare officers under the SUNRISE-OVC project, where data and targeting information was shared with other USAID projects such as the Sustainable Comprehensive Responses for Vulnerable Children and their families project (SCORE) and with smaller civil society organization initiatives in the districts. In contrast, district and sub-county government officials typically used the Child Status Index (CSI) and Child Protection Registration Forms while other OVC projects used the Vulnerability Index. Several projects developed their own tools and approaches. USAID-funded partners might be required to utilize government-endorsed targeting and enrollment tools in order to the consistency of approach across projects and to foster recognition of the government’s role within the system. Those tools might also benefit from some review and modification. \n• Graduation\nGraduation is typically understood as the process of moving a  household, family or child from receiving services (i.e., they are found to be in a place wherein they do not require services). Graduation is also utilized when discussing household economic strengthening and refers to a household moving from one type of economic vulnerability to a less vulnerable level. From key informant interviews with implementing partners, it appears that not all of them have an explicit graduation strategy. Those that do use a range of criteria to graduate beneficiaries including the age of the child, the level of schooling, and (in projects with a strong household economic strengthening component) analysis of household economic vulnerability using a combination of the Vulnerability Index (VI) and CSI or a project-specific assessment tool. USAID, in partnership with the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MGLSD), may want to consider convening a technical working group on graduation. The working group would be tasked with providing definitions of graduation in different contexts, how to measure graduation and what level of resiliency and/or changes in vulnerability can be anticipated over specific time periods ranging from, say, one to five years. \n• Case Management\nThe Portfolio Review found that there is no unified approach to case management and that implementing partners use a range of case management and referral mechanisms. There are two main findings related to case management systems: 1) Lack of a unified approach to case management and 2) lack of a common monitoring and evaluation (M & E) system to support case management. SUNRISE-OVC appears to have placed significant emphasis on developing case management, supporting district and sub-county government officials to use the CSI to complete home visit forms and to track consultations in a case management book. In spite of these achievements, there are inconsistencies within that project in the use of the tools and shortcomings in the existing approach. For example, there is no unique identifier for beneficiaries to assign cases by child or household, rather than by incident. There is also limited reach to deliver services at the community level and a lack of a clear follow-up process to ensure the case is resolved.This review found across the portfolio that there is an absence of unique identifiers, standard case files and/or procedures to store case files, as well as limited movement to transition to electronic case files, which would allow for improved trend analysis and linkages across the system. The National OVC MIS system facilitates tracking children reached, but is not designed as a case management tool, although it has the potential to serve as an important component of a strengthened case management system.\n•  Referral mechanisms\nCase management and referral mechanisms are closely linked. A strong case management system must include clear and coordinated referral procedures to ensure that any given case plan (and the services to be delivered) is followed in a coordinated, timely and child sensitive manner. This review found that each project had some kind of referral system in place that linked health facilities, CSOs and/or government service providers, but that there was significant variation in the specific strategy and effectiveness of these systems. Referral mechanisms reviewed ranged from formal to informal. Some provided the client with a standard referral form, while others relied on word of mouth or direct accompaniment of the client to the next point of service (which can be particularly important for victims of child protection violations such as defilement or abuse). According to key informant interviews, actors from several projects stated that completion of the referral by the client depended on several factors including perceived value of the service by the client, geographic location and distance/transport options to reach the service, availability of the service and whether the client met the selection criteria. Given the gaps and limitations identified in the current system, there’s a need to review and leverage lessons learned from the portfolio and work might be launched to develop standard operating procedures for case management and the associated referral mechanisms. \n\nHIV/AIDS and OVC \nA growing evidence base demonstrates the linkages between HIV and child protection related adversities. For example, there appears to be an association between HIV infection and early sexual debut and/or sexual violence. There is also the increased likelihood of children in households affected by HIV of contracting the disease. Children affected by HIV in turn face protective challenges such as stigma or lack of family or suitable alternative care. The Portfolio Review paid particularly attention to the linkages between HIV and OVC vulnerability, specifically, the identification of pediatric cases, disclosure and treatment adherence, sexual violence and HIV and coordination between community-based OVC services and facility-based care and treatment partners.\n\n• Case identification. \nCare and treatment partners interviewed believed they are exhausting\nefforts to identify HIV+ children that have not been tested or are not receiving appropriate care and treatment. They are conducting near universal testing in pediatric wards, increasing provider initiated testing and follow up (PITC), following up on HIV Exposed Infants (HEI) at\nreproductive health clinics (whose mothers gave birth at home) and increasing HIV testing during antenatal visits. Most are finding low prevalence of HIV among children and question UNAIDS estimates. In contrast, OVC partners know of HIV+ children in their communities who\nnever reach care and treatment centers, likely due to fear of being stigmatized within their communities. Overall, new cases of children has made a noted decrease in the past several years most likely due to an increase in PMTCT services and roll out of ART.\n\n• Disclosure and adherence. \nIn key informant interviews OVC partners expressed concern at the manner in which HIV status of children and their parents is disclosed to children and indicated that clinical staff are often not trained on age-appropriate disclosure communication. Even when children’s status is known, children often fail to access or adhere to treatment due to lack\nof knowledge on drug use and dosage, drug-sharing within families and/or lack of oversight and attention from parents.\n\n• Sexual violence and HIV. \nMost OVC partners understood the linkages between sexual violence and HIV transmission and recognized that child sexual abuse requires both a legal and medical response. That said, not all partners were aware of the 72-hour window for PEP.\n\n• Coordination. \nCoordination between community-based OVC and facility-based care and treatment partners is very limited, although care and treatment partners were receptive to increasing collaboration with the social  service sector. Para social workers and other social welfare actors would benefit from some training on HIV to support pediatric enrollment and\nadherence. Both OVC and care and treatment programs need to identify areas of intersection, whereby both can leverage their comparative expertise to ensure that more children and families are reached with care and treatment services and the social welfare support they need. \n\nUnder SUNRISE-OVC and other projects within the OVC portfolio, USAID programming has resulted in improved coordination and working relationships between government and civil society organizations, as well as across USAID projects. This development is evidenced by a growing number of formal and informal relationships between institutions and projects. Opportunities for further alignment remain – ensuring projects work within and understand government  planning cycles for the fiscal year starting July 1st would help to support OVC priorities within government plans. Likewise more direct leadership to promote coordination by USAID could incentivize partners to align work plans and foster new types of collaboration between implementing partners, particularly OVC and care and treatment partners.

      "Key Recommendations": "The recommendations provided below address key findings of both the SWOT analysis of the USAID OVC Strategy for Uganda as well as the specific technical areas requested by the Mission. Recommendations were developed in a way to address both issues in a holistic and coordinated manner rather than\nseparately.\n\n1. Provide a common language, understanding and approach towards social service system strengthening and child protection amongst USAID and implementing partners that reflect global guidance and national laws, policies and tools.\na. Develop a standardized description of a social service systems strengthening approach based on 2012 PEPFAR OVC Guidance, inclusive of a standardized or agreed upon child protection training for all USAID funded OVC implementing partners.\nb. Encourage IP management participate in a brief management-level orientation on social services, system strengthening and child protection that would assist them to give appropriate support to staff, utilizing existing expertise within Makerere University, Africhild Research Centre and other technical experts.\nc. USAID should consider requiring IPs to use standardized national tools to ensure consistency in targeting methods and reporting across projects whilst also providing venues to leverage IP expertise through constructive engagement with government in an effort to enhance\nnational tools.\n\n2. Actively promote further discussion and IP engagement with government around the issue of graduation.\na. USAID and the Government of Uganda may want to consider convening a technical working group to think through the complex set of issues involved. This could include defining graduation in its different contexts, how to measure it, and what level of resiliency can be\nanticipated over what period of time.\nb. Graduation strategies should be part and parcel of IP sustainability plans.\nc. Convene a multi-sectoral technical working group on graduation with the objective to clarify definitions and updated guidelines and tools based on IP experience in Uganda and elsewhere.\nd. To facilitate graduation, ensure robust household economic strengthening is included in mechanisms to support vulnerable children and households.\n\n3. Identify, better understand and promote effective models of case management and referral mechanisms amongst implementing partners, other service providers and government as well as amongst social welfare and health/HIV sectors.a. Conduct operations research to identify the best referral models/forms, document and scale, including the Bantwana case management model.\nb. Support the development and roll out of agreed upon and evidence-based standard operating procedures for case management.\nc. Encourage IPs to use existing tools (e.g., MEASURE and QI) to assess, monitor and improve referral networks.\nd. Define the business processes for case management prior to adopting an electronic case management system or adapting the OVC MIS. There may be lessons learned from Child Helpline.\n\n4. A growing evidence base illustrates the linkages between HIV affected and infected children and increased vulnerability to child  protection risks as well as the increased risk of HIV faced by child survivors of child protection violations. USAID Uganda is in a unique position to strengthen and facilitate improved coordination between OVC and social welfare system strengthening efforts and care and treatment partners and promote synergies between child protection and HIV programming, wherever possible.\na. Ensure facility-based counselors/social workers have linkages with community-based service providers.\nb. Leverage existing PLHIV support groups, expert clients, VHTs and para social workers to encourage parents/caregiver to access HCT and ART for children.\nc. Add a module into the child protection and para social worker trainings to ensure Community Development Officers (CDOs) and para social workers have basic knowledge in PEP, ART adherence, disclosure, stigma, available resources and identification of children at risk of HIV and HIV+ children.\nd. Encourage care and treatment partners to include a social work position within health facilities and/or to actively link with para social workers, CDOs and PWOs to foster cross referral of potential child protection cases identified in HIV/health clinics and/or HIV cases\nidentified by child protection sector. This can and should include the development of a training module for doctors, nurses and other health facility staff to recognize signs of abuseor neglect in children.\ne. Support care and treatment providers to develop and implement child safeguarding policies as is expected by OVC partners. \n\n5. Increase access to HIV testing, treatment and care especially amongst children and adolescents. \na. Encourage care and treatment partners to better understand the role that the care environment and neglect has on adherence amongst children and adolescents. For example, many children are living with extended family or elderly caregivers and because of stigma and/or neglect are not able to receive medical care and treatment. Many of these families are vulnerable and could be part of the social worker’s caseload thereby requiring improved coordination and communication between the social welfare and health sectors.\nb. Support child and adolescent friendly clinics and support groups.\nc. Support the recruitment and training of clinic-based staff with skills to work with children and adolescents.\nd. Leverage expert clients, para social workers, VHTs and other community-based structures to support adherence.\n\n6. Strengthen coordination mechanisms amongst USAID, Implementing Partners and the Government of Uganda.a. Using its convening power, USAID could create a collaboration and coordination platform leveraging the strengths of each mechanism to advance OVC objectives (as a complement tothe National OVC Steering Committee).\nb. Create opportunities for joint work planning across USAID OVC and USAID non-OVC mechanisms and the GOU.\nc. Continue to support DOVCCs and DOPs as an effective means of coordination at the district level.\n\n7. Aim to reduce the number of implementing partners focusing on those with the technical skills and foci identified in the PEPFAR  Guidance for OVC Programming, with particular focus on those that have experience and expertise in system strengthening, household economic strengthening, child protection, workforce development and case management and referral systems. \na. Try to avoid funding small, OVC components as additions to larger non-OVC focused project and instead focus on funding of projects within projects that are led by organizations with experience and expertise that is relevant to OVC priority areas. \nb. Encourage implementing partners to engage with and seek information from globally recognized entities with technical expertise e.g., Global Social Service Workforce Alliance, RIATT, etc.",

      "Key Findings": "Overall, the team found the two programs to be effective and successful, with well-organized management systems. This is an especially noteworthy accomplishment given the extremely difficult working conditions in Burkina Faso over the last two to three years. There is, however, room for improvement in any program. There exist cross cutting themes that, if properly addressed, will make the extension of the programs more successful. Many of the evaluators’ observations had previously been made by program staff and discussed in several planning meetings and documents prior to this evaluation.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1) In order to build resilient communities, a comprehensive approach is needed that combines risk reduction activities (infrastructure, appropriate seeds and tools, livestock protection activities, etc.), early warning and disaster response, and livelihood recovery. Take the time to build consensus: Develop dialogue and accountability mechanisms between key local actors, such as government, customary institutions, civil society associations, and the private sector.\n\n2) The extension phase of the programs should focus on interventions that will contribute to the pursuit of good governance, which needs to be a high priority strategy involving the building of both formal and informal institutions and relationships and implemented at the state, community and household levels. However, the community level is a particularly critical level at which to build resilience. The most vulnerable must be helped, in particular, by communities and institutions such as VDCs, PTAs, and WUAs.\n\n3) Although some cultural, social and economic constraints do remain, FASO and ViM must intensify their efforts to increase the leadership role that women play in their professional lives and in their communities.",

      "Document Title": "Guide to the Good Governance Barometer",
      "Key Findings": "Partner communities in Senegal chose a variety of focus subjects, or core questions, for the GGB. Examples include health sector governance, education sector governance, environmental management, land management, conflict management, and financial management. While quantitative scores are easy to digest, improvements in numbers cannot tell the full story of GGB impact in partner communities. Those numbers are tied to tangible improvements in governance, service delivery to citizens, and overall quality of life. Selected results follow.\n\nHEALTH\nIn the rural community of Sabodala, GGB analysis identified a dysfunctional health committee as a major weakness in health sector governance. The GGB action plan called for the revitalization of a functional and well-trained health committee with members appointed by consensus. This committee facilitated the opening of a new health center in the community with a dedicated bank account and two new nurses. The health committee appointed an independent treasurer in charge of revenue management. This newfound energy and transparency led to new opportunities for partnership and resources. Mining companies active in the area saw the health committee as a responsible partner and invested in the training and hiring of new midwives. They also donated medicines to the health center and agreed on a quarterly grant for the health sector in Sabodala. In the rural community of Thienaba, GGB analysis identified poor health center management as a major weakness. \n\nThe GGB action plan called for a complete overhaul of health center procedures. Purchasing and inventory practices were particularly problematic, with little regard for record keeping, budgeting or separation of duties. According to a local official, “People now have steady access to the medicines they need. Our health center managers now consult the health committee before making financial transactions, especially the treasurer. All invoices for purchases are on file and available for review. Our budgeting and record keeping practices are standard. Today, thanks to the support of PGP, our health clinic managers and health committees have new knowledge and management tools. I can say that they have better control of their roles and responsibilities. From my point of view, we’re making a lot of progress in the management of the health sector.”\n\nCONFLICT MANAGEMENT/NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT\nIn the rural community of Diende, competition over land and water resources is a major source of conflict. The GGB analysis identified poor or nonexistent resource management mechanisms as a major weakness. The GGB action plan called for the construction of a communal pastoral well dedicated to watering livestock, the clear demarcation of paths for livestock movement, and the creation of community dialogue commission for the resolution of conflict. Together these conflict management techniques have created the conditions necessary for successful conflict management and sustainable peace.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The analysis of project documents and interviews with 10 KIs showed that the project used three main ways to address gender issues during both the design and implementation of its activities: 1) included gender in annual work plans; 2) initiated the external assessment of the level of gender integration within P3DP activities; and 3) addressed about half of assessment recommendations in project activities. A full scope of actual effects of pilot PPPs had not materialized yet by the time of evaluation, given that only two pilot projects were launched and were on the early stages of implementation. The survey and KIIs revealed positive expectations associated with pilot PPPs and with municipal PPPs in general. For each expected pilot PPP that could have an effect on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, P3DP ordered, during feasibility studies, a special technical study aimed at estimating an expected impact of a suggested technical solution (e.g. a new boiler in Malyn) on the emissions. P3DP’s assistance on preparation and launch of pilot PPPs is generally well appreciated by the participants, with a few technical caveats",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. (Future programming). Taking into consideration the complexity of PPP projects, it is suggested for the implementing entity to consider including a position of a part-time local gender specialist.\n\n2. (Future programming). If another project that supports municipal PPPs is funded, its design and work plan must require much earlier launches of PPPs than happened at P3DP. In particular, the PPP pipeline should not be postponed to the last year.\n\n3. (Current project). Make a focused and urgent effort to radically simplify a PPP preparation and procurement process. \n\n4. (Current project). If the task under Recommendation 3 is implemented successfully, follow up by developing a package of model documents that would specify the concept of the\nsimplified process.\n\n5. (Future programming). If another project of supporting municipal PPPs is funded, it should consider diversifying further the regulatory and procedural approaches to PPPs, compared to “quick fixes” considered and developed within P3DP, under Recommendation 3 & 4.",

      "Key Findings": "The four key principles were already well integrated into the standard procedures of almost all major conservation-based implementing partners, but SCAPES annual meetings and other learning activities have helped develop and refine these concepts. The SCAPES program was designed during a period in USAID management when gender considerations did not have the prominence that they have today. Evaluators conducted and analyzed the fourth LFA carried out during SCAPES. Each theory of change identified common actions, intermediate results, threats, and biodiversity targets across SCAPES and provided a framework evaluators used to assess outcomes of seven major conservation strategies, such as land protection, law enforcement, and climate change.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Establish a reasonably sized landscape to support in light of threats and opportunities; the boundaries of the landscape (physical, governmental, biodiversity, ethnic) should be defined in the context of funding limitations.\n• Ascertain if a transboundary cooperation component is needed to effectively address certain threats.\n\n• Set a reasonable duration for USAID support. Despite typical USAID procurement limits of five years or less, several USAID programs have been authorized for longer periods, such as 20 years for both Integrated Conservation of the Andean Amazon and the Central Africa Regional Program for the Environment in with five-year phases.\n\n• Prioritize a limited number of problems to address in the context of the comparative advantages of USAID and its implementing partners.\n\n• Carefully discuss how best to partner with other non–USAID-funded organizations working in the landscape and reduce duplicate multiple-donor reporting requirements.",

      "Document Title": "Final Performance Evaluation of the Marine Resources Program: Enhancing Management Capacity",
      "Key Findings": "How has the last five years of investment in the MRP \"moved the dial\" on attitudes toward and abilities for achieving sustainability in fisheries management? \nMMAF’s draft RENSTRA marks a significant shift in the Ministry’s commitment for and approach to sustainable capture fisheries, as compared to earlier strategies. MMAF requested technical assistance from IMACS to provide technical advice on RENSTRA recommendations to promote sustainable capture fisheries and aquaculture. To this end, IMACS developed an Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing dashboard to estimate economic loss from illegal fishing practices. The dashboard development marks an effective partnership between IMACS and the MMAF to ensure the sustainability of Indonesia’s fisheries. IMACS also supported the MMAF’s efforts to develop a long-term strategic view for capture fisheries and aquaculture, beyond the RENSTRA’s 5-year timespan.\nA second example is the implementation of a Fisheries Management Plan (FMP) for Fisheries Management Area (Wilayah Pengelolaan Perikanan, WPP) 718 in the Arafura Sea. The FMP illustrates the GOI’s commitment to sustainable capture fisheries, achieved through an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM). The MRP was a crucial resource during the development of the WPP 718 FMP and provided best-practice models for key MMAF staff.\n\nWhat can we learn about building the national government’s capacity to provide technical training by comparing the different approaches implemented according to the MRP? \nA collaborative and integrative approach for training leads to more effective program implementation, compared with a consultative training approach. Although the MRP included capacity building activities at the national and regional levels and covered a wide range of topics for diverse target audiences, the internalization of training content within the MMAF remains  incomplete. Increased knowledge and enhanced skills, supported by an\nintegrated program, will deepen key capacities and should be a priority for future programming.\n\nA variety of approaches to capacity building were employed by MRP partners, and the MPAG approach was found to be the most successful. The MPAG prioritized local resources and empowering stakeholders, including experts hired by the key NGO consortium to assist the MMAF DG with regional and national MPAG implementation. IMACS’s deployment of distance consultancy support to compensate for a lack of national-level stakeholders was found to be ineffective. Furthermore, at the regional level, staff lacked sufficient authority as decision-makers and, therefore, functioned primarily as officers. The NOAA-IAA’s lack of provisions to hire local experts challenged their capacity to facilitate project activities. \n\nHow have the last five years of investment in the MRP strengthened the enabling institutional conditions needed to implement an effective national system of MPAs? \nMRP investment in strengthening an effective national system of MPAs has been perceived as a valuable contribution by MMAF. The MPAG supported the establishment of eight MPAs covering nearly five million hectares. 16 out of 20 million hectares throughout Indonesia have s been established as MPAs. Furthermore, MMAF acknowledged Technical Guidelines for Evaluating the Management Effectiveness of Aquatic, Coastal, and Small Island Conservation Areas (Evaluasi Efektifitas Pengelolaan Kawasan Konservasi Pesisir dan\nPulau-pulau Kecil, E-KKP3K) and seven guidebooks and decision support systems (DSS), prepared as part of the MRP. Finally, six MPAs were evaluated using the E-KKP3K tool.\n\nThe existence of an E-KKP3K tool provides a strong foundation to evaluate and improve MPA management and development in the future. The new decree issued with MRP support on standard competences (SK3) has set a new standard/benchmark for MPA managers in enabling MMAF institution to better manage MPA development. However, the effectiveness of executing this competency standard will depend on the supporting institutional working mechanism within the relevant national and local authorities. Although the MRP has supported the development of eight MPAs, the framework for a sustainable financing mechanism to support the MPA’s future development still needs to be institutionalized at the national and local levels with potential support from outside funding.\n\nWhat can we learn about the status and trends of MPA Management Effectiveness in Indonesia from the work of MRP?\nOut of the eight major MPAs supported by the MPAG program, only Nusa Penida has produced quantitative data to show program implementation achievements and outcomes. Elsewhere, monitoring data is limited. An assessment of the impact of the MPAG initiative on biodiversity in Nusa Penida MPA, of which MPAG was the primary funding source during the period in question, reveals an increase in coral cover and fish abundance in the MPA (see page 38).\n\nThe use of the E-KKP3K assessment tool to assess MPA management effectiveness has been a valuable process. More than 20 sites were assessed during Year 1, in order to establish a baseline and track improvements through to Year 3. The assessment shows significant improvements in the conservation areas’ management status across the main 8 MPAs supported by the MPAG program. The most significant achievement was noted in the Aquatic National Park, Savu Sea, where management status improved from level of Yellow to Green and, finally, Blue between the years 2012 and 2014. In total, MPAs supported by the MPAG initiatives account for nearly five million hectares, or more than\none third of the total MPA area.\n\nGiven the lessons learned through this analysis, key changes in the institutional arrangements for coastal management in Indonesia, and the current political climate, what opportunities and risks should USAID have in mind as we implement our next coastal-marine project?\nThe WPPs established by the MMAF are crucial for the sustainability of capture fisheries. The FMP established for WPP 718 in the Arafura Sea, for which the MRP has provided critical assistance, is a pioneer case study for the future of the EAFM in Indonesia. The development and approach process for the WPP 718 FMP informed the development of\nthe other ten FMPs. These were submitted to the MMAF for enactments in July 2015.",
      "Key Recommendations": "KEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nHow have the last 5 years of investment in the MRP \"moved the dial\" on attitudes toward and abilities for achieving sustainability in fisheries management?\nThe MMAF has recognized the importance of IMACS’s support to facilitate and enrich its new strategic direction. IMACS’s support for the development of the RENSTRA marks an important step towards ensuring sustainable fisheries management. However, future\nmarine programs should also utilize the RENSTRA as a point of reference for program development. Therefore, a joint or integrated work plan between the USAID and MMAF should be taken into account.\n2. USAID is advised to build upon initial investments to assist the MMAF with the Arafura WPP 718 FMP by providing further support for refinement and implementation, including more effective management of fisheries efforts, illegal fishing abatement, stakeholder socialization, the development of individual stock management plans for constituent\nfisheries, and the development of additional FMPs. All such activities should be implemented in concurrence with WPP FMP execution.\nSOW QUESTION 1. THEME 2. What can we learn about building the national\ngovernment’s capacity to provide technical trainings by comparing the different\napproaches implemented in the MRP?\n1. The development of an integrated strategy with key partners in the early stage of program\nimplementation will improve effectiveness and avoid confusion within an institution where\ndifferent mechanisms operate simultaneously for capacity building. The strategy should\nidentify the respective roles of each partner and establish a system for collaboration.\n2. Out of several approaches to capacity building, the MPAG approach was the most\nappreciated by both MMAF and DKP staff, and should be taken as a model for future\ninterventions. Though lacking a fully integrated approach, IMACS’s work on the\ndevelopment of the Indonesia Climate Adaptation Tool for Coastal Habitats (I-CATCH),\nIndonesia Fisheries Information System (I-Fish), FMPs, WPPs, and the draft RENSTRA\nwere deemed to be valuable contributions. A future MRP should prioritize program\nintegration beginning in the early planning stages, in order to ensure consistency and avoid\nconfusion between partners.\n3. Provisions must be made for flexibility and adjustments to planned activities and program\nimplementation, due to changing political dynamics and bureaucracy. This will help to\nensure the achievement of program objectives.\n1. SOW QUESTION 2. THEME 3. How have the last 5 years of investment in\nMRP strengthened the enabling institutional conditions needed to\nimplement an effective national system of MPAs? In order to achieve the total\ntarget expansion of MPAs to 20 million hectares by 2020, USAID should continue to\nwork together with the MMAF. MPA manager capacity building will constitute one of\nthe strategic investments for USAID.\n2. The MPAG’s collaborative approach in working with the MMAF and other NGO\npartners to identify and support the MMAF’s fisheries sustainability and conservation\nagendas may be considered an example of best-practice for institutional partnerships.\nThis approach should be undertaken and further strengthened in future programs, as\noutlined in the RENSTRA 2015-2019.\n3. As of the close of this program in 2015, a total of eight MPAs have received MRP\nsupport, while an additional 16 have been identified as priorities for future projects. The\nprovision of USAID assistance to develop a framework for sustainable financing for\nfuture MPAs, institutionalized at the national and local levels, will help to ensure future\nMPA development.\nSOW QUESTION 2. THEME 4. What can we learn about the status and trends of\nMPA management effectiveness in Indonesia from the work of MRP?\n1. The next marine project should take into account institutional governance and\ncoordination schemes, as exhibited in the Multi-Stakeholder Forum for MPA\nManagement in Gili Matra (a national MPA) and Nusa Penida (a district MPA), in order\nto achieve successful program implementation.\n2. Future MPA-support projects should include appropriate monitoring and evaluation of\nbiophysical indicators to enable an understanding of project impacts.\n3. The USAID’s next program strategy should closely integrate fisheries management with\ncoastal biodiversity conservation efforts. This will provide favorable conditions for\nenabling fisheries management to create multiplier effects for coastal biodiversity and\nsustainable livelihoods.\nSOW QUESTIONS 3. THEME 5. Given the lessons learned through this analysis,\nkey changes in the institutional arrangements for coastal management in\nIndonesia, and the current political climate, what opportunities and risks should\nUSAID have in mind as we implement our next coastal-marine project?\n1. In relation to new local autonomy laws (UU No 23 of 2014, j/o UU 9/2015), the next\nUSAID marine project should consider the integration and knowledge transfer of coastal\nmanagement initiatives at the regency level to the Provincial Government. USAID\nshould support further support institutional arrangements in the Provincial Government\nto strengthen their role in coastal management development.\n2. The E-KKP3K assessment tool and the Seven Guide books on MPA management and\ndevelopment, produced by MMAF with assistance from MPAG, should be more widely\ndisseminated within MMAF, the Ministry of Forestry and Environment, and the regional\nlevel for the protection of coastal biodiversity. This will build up a sense of ownership\nfor the management of MPAs at the local level and help to ensure the sustainability of\ninitiatives.\n3. In regard to the small grants program for coastal communities, the next USAID project\nshould consider shifting away from supporting many individual pilots to a more focused\napproach that is better aligned with program priorities, monitored closely, and better\nsupported and sustained by being effectively embedded within a broader supportive\ninstitutional context.",

The level of understanding/support for PSE, however, varies within the GOR and there is a lack of systems and knowledge about how to engage the private sector, especially to develop PPPs. There is also a lack of effective coordination and clarity of roles and responsibilities between key stakeholders (MOH, RDB, RBC) that is limiting effective PSE. There is a lack of adequate capacity within the MOH, RDB, and RBC for effective PSE and PPP development and is limited dialogue and no formal platforms or systems for public and private engagement.",

      "Key Findings": "PSE is not an end within itself and while it is an instrument that can be used in the promotion of humanitarian response, it should be sought in view of the value it presents and its capacity to be appropriately used. Engagements by the private sector should be undertaken in partnership with experienced humanitarian actors in order to conform to the humanitarian principles embodied in the Red Cross/Crescent and NGO Code of Conduct. Partnerships with private sector should seek to be long-term, so that both parties are able to develop a meaningful relationship and promote sustained engagement. The quality of engagements presents more value to humanitarian providers rather than the quantity. The bottom line for all private sector humanitarian agency engagement should always be supporting humanitarian outcomes. The partnership should not lead to the disruption of local markets, and should seek to assist in restoring them instead. The basis for engagement centres around the core business of both parties involved. There needs to be a tangible benefit for both sides for the partnership to grow and be successful. A considerable investment of resources is needed by partners to bring forth deep partnerships capable of achieving significant impact at scale. To build positive relationships between the business and NGOs, time should be scheduled, budgets allocated and programs established, all with a commitment to the partnership.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This report suggests that the humanitarian sector, when creating private sector partnerships, should: \n1. Develop private sector \"good practice\" guidelines. \n2. Facilitate further strategic and operational dialogue between key stakeholders by developing innovation hubs and establishing regular meetings and forums between key humanitarian providers and leaders in business. \n\nCARE International (and CARE Australia in particular) should: \n1. Deepen current relationships in logistics. \n2. Build on established process for collaboration. \n3. Explore innovative partnership opportunities. ",

      "Key Findings": "The evidence suggests that significant efforts will be necessary to acquire financing. The total amount of international public finance for LEDS in the AFOLU sector – as for climate change more generally – is likely to fall short of expectation, and will not be sufficient to fund the\nambitious goals set by many developing countries. At the same time, the limited public finances that are available often remain undisbursed due to the lack of investment-ready projects or questions over financial management capacities and safeguards implementation.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The landscape of finance available for LEDS in the AFOLU sector is complex and diverse.\nWhile many LEDS proponents will be tempted to seek only familiar sources of financing, the\nbenefits for those who seek to cast their net wider are likely to be considerable. Taking this\npath will not be without challenges. In the first place, LEDS proponents will need to familiarize\nthemselves with the finance landscape relevant to their jurisdiction and the sectors and sub-\nsectors they operate within. They will need to establish connections with a broader range of\nactors and understand their interests and concerns. In many cases, they will need to take a\nrisk in pursuing a strategy that has yet to be tested.\n\nThe challenges inherent in financing LEDS mean that financing considerations must be at the\nheart of LEDS design. Proponents should not first design their LEDS and then seek financing,\nbut rather design strategies based around the kinds and amounts of finance available.\nSimilarly, involving potential funders at an early stage is crucial to ensuring that strategies are\nsuitably designed and also ensures that funders become invested at an early stage. In this\nsense, low-emission development strategies and LEDS funding strategies must be considered\nas two sides of the same coin, and integrated from the start.",

      "Key Findings": "Based on the interviews conducted for this report, the PNG private sector’s view on investing in low emissions land use initiatives in PNG can be characterised as: (1) ‘open for discussion’ but new to the topic and not well informed, yet keen to learn more; (2) ‘broadly aware’ that investment in ‘green’ initiatives could benefit their corporate legitimacy and social responsibility obligations; and (3) ‘cautiously interested’ to contribute funds, but have major concerns that funding may be misappropriated (through corruption), particularly if PNG government entities are involved.\n\nIn summary, it appears that the private sector in PNG is potentially interested in investment in low carbon land use initiatives, but is presently poorly informed, cautious and skeptical and unlikely to voluntarily contribute any funds in the short-term (within the next 12 months), other than perhaps small-scale (e.g. US$25,000 to US$50,000) project specific-based funding.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The author recommends LEAF take the following two distinct short-term actions to pursue private sector funding opportunities (assuming no major advancements occur with REDD+ policy internationally or domestically).\n\nFirst, LEAF should forge a strong working relationship with the Ramu Development Fund (RDF; a fund recently established by the Madang Provincial Government that collects mandatory contributions from private sector business developers in the Province) to encourage and facilitate the RDF to include low emissions land use issues in its funding purview and possible submit to the RDF a proposal for the RDF to fund some of LEAF’s work in Madang.\n\nSecond, LEAF should forge a strong working relationship with the Port Moresby Chamber of Commerce.`",

      "Document Title": "Finance Case Study",
      "Key Findings": "Through nearly 40 interviews, reviews of data from the other studies and secondary data analysis, we have been able to piece together a sense of what is happening regarding financing\nof humanitarian innovation. The key finding is that the humanitarian system has made a start in funding innovation, but that it is still a long way from where it needs to be. Our research leads us to estimate that, although growing, funding for humanitarian innovation is low. We estimate that innovation funding by OECD DAC members is around US$37.5 million per year, the\nequivalent of 0.27% of their humanitarian response funding in 2013. This percentage would be\nexceptionally low in an industry that had little material consequence, such as paper milling. In an industry seeking to save and support millions of lives and livelihoods in the face of disaster, it is not exceptionally low; it is breathtakingly low.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Institutional Donors\n1) Structure the market: For both the wider humanitarian sector and the\ninnovation ecosystem that is reliant on its functioning, there is a clear need for\nhumanitarian donors to think differently about how they are incentivising the\nmarket. Porter in his work on competitive strategy uses a model called structure, conduct and performance. 30 Donors have significant influence over the structure the humanitarian sector (by who they fund, how they fund, the\nrequirements they set, the output and impact they stipulate etc.), which in turn drives conduct in the industry. This conduct ultimately dictates the\nperformance of the humanitarian actors in the system. The challenges outlined above show some of the areas where proactive donor action to structure the market and incentivise the innovation ecosystem could drive changes in conduct and performance of humanitarian agencies.\n2) Increase funding: Innovation funding is less than 0.27% of total humanitarian\nfunding. This is insufficient by any industry standard. Disaster affected\ncommunities deserve better solutions to the hazards they face. Therefore it is\nincumbent upon all involved in humanitarian action that better solutions are invested in. We would recommend a target of 1.5% of humanitarian response funding being allocated to supporting humanitarian innovation.\n3) Facilitate new entrants: By structuring the market, changing some of the eligibility rules, investing in incubators and accelerators and committing to forward purchasing and revising procurement guidelines, donors can create an\nenabling environment for new entrants, large and small alike to bring new\ninnovations into the sector.\n4) Significant steps have been taken to introduce innovation funding. However,\nmore nuanced behaviour must follow; of being investors and not customers.\nFunding innovation is an investment in potential future impact, not in impact\nwhose value is already known. Understanding investment decision-making criteria across industries would help this.\n5) Provide more financing phases: More phases of funding are needed in order to enable the scaling up and scaling out of innovations through taking a more incremental approach to reducing risk.\n6) Invest in the development of M&E frameworks, evidence building, risk and\nportfolio management for both yourselves and implementers.\n7) Invest in enabling innovations for impact and enabling infrastructure for\ninnovation\n8) Reconsider planned reductions in flexible funding frameworks: Donors should reconsider the trend of moving away from flexible/core funding framework agreements with implementing agencies. Their long term and fungible nature enables good agencies to use it for sustained innovation journeys.\nPrivate Sector and Foundations\n1) Think beyond single partnerships to ecosystem building: Invest in bilateral\npartnerships if you want to support limited scale, i.e. solutions that a single\nagency will implement. Invest in joint ventures and multi-stakeholder\npartnerships if you are seeking large-scale transformations.\n3) Consider the need for accountability and transparency for your investment:\nWhenever possible be open about your investments into humanitarian work, as\nthis enables more coherency and better coordination of resources for the\nbenefit of disaster affected communities.\n4) Stick to what you know: bring your core competencies and invest in innovation in-line with them.\n5) Continue to invest and engage in humanitarian innovation. The value you are creating is appreciated by those within the sector.\n6) Work with humanitarian actors with experience to contextualise your rich\ninnovation knowledge to the peculiarities of humanitarian action.\nThe Three Pillars: UN, NGOs and Red Cross Movement\n1) Invest your innovation money in line with your strategy and core competencies.\n2) Collaborate more: seek to work on joint problems with other humanitarian\nactors and private sector to ensure greater chances of success.\n3) Look to increasing your absorption and scaling capabilities: your role is not just to develop new innovations, but also to absorb and implement innovations that are invented in your peer agencies. By opening up to each other’s innovations you will be able to take innovations to scale and have a greater impact on disaster affected communities lives.\n4) Look at joint ventures and acquisitions and investing in external innovations: Look to not only collaborate with peers, but build joint ventures and even acquire small start-ups; both private and third sector ones. Open up your innovation funds to smaller more nimble partners.\n5) Ask the hard questions. Go beyond investing in incremental innovations and seek to be disruptive, even if it means risking your organisations existence in its current form.",

      "Key Findings": "INVC has introduced technologies and practices related to land preparation, crop management, harvest and post-harvest practices, and storage and marketing for groundnuts and soybeans. INVC did not report yield data in fiscal year (FY) 2013, but in FY2014 it reported groundnut yields of 0.87 metric tons/ha (MT/ha) and soybean yields of 0.67 MT/ha— 7 percent and 11 percent below their respective baseline levels of 0.93 MT/ha and 0.75 MT/ha.\n\nThe Consortium has supported collective marketing options for farmers predominantly through ACE, giving them leverage in negotiating for their crops by providing them with market intelligence. The INVC BCC Strategy on Nutrition and Agriculture Value Chains in Malawi is implemented through Farmers Clubs and the Community Care Group (CCG) Model. INVC has implemented an LCD component to help its partners better implement the project and prepare to become direct USAID awardees.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Assess legume cultivation in the ZOI. USAID should follow up on the ongoing University of North Carolina impact evaluation of INVC to assess groundnut and soybean cultivation in the ZOI. Farmers who did not grow these crops prior to INVC should be surveyed to assess their ongoing cultivation to determine if\nthey grew these crops only during INVC implementation or if they permanently adopted them in their portfolio.\n\nTap the potential of women. The Consortium and sub-partners should emphasize reaching out to women farmers as innovators and early adopters.\n\nContinue to distribute high-quality seeds. NASFAM\nand CADECOM should continue to distribute high-quality groundnut and soybean seeds as an incentive to introduce farmers to improved varieties. Distribution should continue each season throughout the life of the project.\n\nContinue intercropping training. AFOs should continue to train farmers in the benefits of intercropping. This training should make clear that it is acceptable to mix crops and that pigeon peas will not compete with the primary crop (i.e., groundnuts or soybeans). For farmers who have already learned about\nintercropping, reinforcement training should be conducted so any misunderstandings, such as crops conflicting with each other, are clarified.\n\nNew approaches to pest/weed management. Because so many farmers interviewed cannot afford to purchase pesticides and herbicides, emphasis should be placed elsewhere regarding pest/weed management.\n",

It also sought to align itself with changes in the education sector’s political and institutional context, which required programmatic changes that could not keep pace with the changes in the context. However, the program design did not account for the opportunities and threats posed by the implementation context, nor did it have the capacity to manage these risks as they arose. SUMA also carried out a pedagogical model with a package of methodological tools (classroom / school / community) appropriate for rural multi-grade schools, which contributed to the policy of quality and equitable education. Lastly, at the district area level, SUMA developed a local governance model that put into practice what education policy proposed in terms of a decentralized management model oriented towards the achievement of learning.",
      "Key Recommendations": " During the strategic planning for a policy and regulatory reform intervention, identify and plan to monitor all critical assumptions and risks; for implementation, identify a flexible management\napproach that allows regular adaptations to an evolving environment.\n Improve monitoring of the intervention, defining hierarchical and articulated results, and designing indicators to measure processes, outputs and outcomes.\n Ensure that the project timeframe is sufficient to allow for the completion of the different project phases, budgeting time for adjustments as reasonable.\n Include a gender focus on interventions that seek to improve learning, given the differences measured between boys and girls in the results of the national learning achievement test.\n Link primary education with pre-primary education based on the evidence that early childhood stimulation contributes to reading and writing during the initial years of primary school.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Effectiveness & Impact\n Work closely with human resource departments of the partner organizations so as to en-\nsure that the graduates who qualify for placement are matched with the skills needed by the potential employers. This will enhance the workplace environment and increase\nchances of interns transitioning to full-time employment after their internship placement period.\n Allow the intern to determine his/her placement while taking into consideration the matching educational background (skills) with the needs of the employers. This increases the possibility that after the placement period, the interns will transition into fulltime employment with the host employer. The interns will also be placed in an area which is in line with their training (educational background), thus enabling them to acquire relevant skills and experience.\n\nSustainability & Scalability\n Continue to contribute to policy development relating to the national volunteer programs\nand Youth Venture Capital Fund. While UIP has encouraged government engagement in the program, continued engagement with the government is essential to realizing a na-\ntional policy.\n Alternative and diverse sources of funding, besides donor funding, need to be sourced to sustain the internship program. Looking to local sources of funding, private and public, will increase the chances of securing funds for the program.",

      "Key Recommendations": "USAID should design the next project to incorporate a much closer link between the social marketing, service delivery and social and behavior change communications (SBCC) projects. In addition, the link with any project working on procurement and supply chain, including capacity building, should be clearly spelled out. The creation of demand through SBCC, the social marketing of related products and the public supply of products needed once demand is created are all interconnected and critical to results and impact.",

      "Document Title": "Local Governance Decentralization Program (LOGODEP) Final Performance Evaluation ",
      "Key Findings": "LOGODEP achieved its objectives in an integrated, holistic manner. It took into account local culture, traditions, and power dynamics and helped create a sense of ownership. It is one of the rare local governance programs in Ghana to have national impact. Its two great achievements are the Presidential Directive on Street Naming and adding spatial planning into medium-term development plan guidance. LOGODEP did an excellent job of building district capacity to use satellite maps and GIS for participatory planning. By knowing where projects are planned, the use of digitized GIS maps can build responsiveness, equity, and accountability and facilitate private investment. The central government’s failure to provide equipment, high-quality satellite maps, and GIS training to MMDAs outside of the Western Region has prevented most MMDAs from implementing the medium-term development plan (MTDP) guidance fully.\n\nWhile it is too early to assess the full impact on IGF, IGF revenue increased in all five target districts and is expected to increase further in 2015. The LOGODEP approach is very cost-effective, as the system will generate enough revenue to cover the cost of the system by 2017. This result contributes to the attractiveness of this model for replication nationwide. The central government oversaw spatial planning and street naming in a manner that may alienate MMDAs. Only 4% of MMDAs, mainly LOGODEP’s target districts, completed the street naming process by January 2015. The unrealistic deadline and poor resource planning contributed to refusal by some MMDAs to implement the directive. By requiring MMDAs to expend their own funds without creating a sense of ownership, the central government showed that it is not yet fully committed to decentralization. \n\nAs such, political will for fiscal decentralization in particular at the highest levels is weak. LOGODEP’s National Linkages Manager has enabled the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD) to support the street naming initiative nationwide. When LOGODEP closes, his departure will make it difficult for the Ministry to maintain its support. Canada may second an IGF technical assistant to the MLGRD. For most MMDAs, public-private partnerships (PPPs) are not yet a feasible option to increase resources and development impact. The decision to extend LOGODEP by two years has paid off. Three years was inadequate for the program, to achieve its objectives, and the two extra years gave it the time needed to have nationwide impact. \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "RECOMMENDATIONS\n Allow LOGODEP to end with no additional funding. Before it ends, focus on consolidating gains and\nensuring sustainability of program results. If elections are held, provide additional assistance to fe-\nmale candidates. Initiate a wide-ranging communications campaign, engaging stakeholders at the na-\ntional, regional, and district levels, as well as other donors, to highlight program accomplishments\nand build demand for follow-on program. Install dlREV in remaining districts and build capacity to\nuse it effectively. Continue to integrate dlREV into the Ghana Integrated Financial Management Sys-\ntem (GIFMIS). Continue to support IGF collection, facilitate IGF performance reviews, and bolster\naudit capacity. \n Consider a follow-on project that replicates the LOGODEP approach elsewhere in Ghana, including:\nsocial accountability; citizen education; tax enforcement; audit strengthening; sub-district strengthen-\ning; community radio capacity building; collaboration with traditional authorities; CSO grants; inte-\ngrating dlREV and GIFMIS; improving MTDP guidance and increasing central funding; helping re-\nsolve problems of technical ministry decentralization; and addressing MMDA land valuation for IGF collection.",

Shared accountability by host countries and donors must be present; goals and burdens must be a mutual responsibility.  The private sector must be heard; ongoing dialogue between government and private trade organizations must be prioritized; and trading community views and recommendations should be given strong consideration in the drafting of new trade laws and regulations.\n\nAdditionally, there must be a whole-of-government approach: the integration of agencies other than Customs into trade facilitation efforts is critical. It is essential that a quality assurance mechanism be put in place at the project outset and that a reporting system is established at the very highest level that brings problems to the early attention of senior management and informs any change to strategic direction.",

      "Document Title": "Visakhapatnam, India Sanitation Assessment: Final Report",
      "Key Findings": "Strong political will exists to accelerate sanitation improvements. The current Municipal Commissioner of the GVMC, Mr. Pravin Kumar, IAS, is a champion of sanitation and the Smart City Initiative. He participated in the 2015 International Fecal Sludge Management 3 Conference in Hanoi, Vietnam, and has an impressive technical understanding of the city’s current sanitation needs. During meetings with the assessment team, Mr. Kumar confirmed our initial findings and provided additional insights into numerous areas of improvement needed along the SVC. His commitment to improving sanitation was echoed by the cooperation of multiple department heads within the GVMC and the impressive understanding of their existing service needs and successes. Sanitation sector stakeholders are eager to engage with the GVMC and improve sanitation services. The assessment team conducted individual and small group interviews with over 40 professionals with a role in the sanitation sector of Visakhapatnam. During the Sanitation Town Hall, these stakeholders were given a platform to voice strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to achieving universal sanitation in Visakhapatnam. The consultation facilitated discussions on critical concerns and topics such as STPs and increasing access to household toilets; a participatory mapping exercise captured the network interactions across the different stakeholder groups. Workshop participants came away with a better understanding of the multitude of actors working in the sector. Communication channels between civil society organizations and the GVMC should be formalized. \n\nAccountability could be strengthened across all stakeholders, but particularly around private service providers (community toilets) and the members of the vacuum truck association. The Town Hall SWOT revealed general consensus that a solid foundation exists in the city for the provision of sanitation services. The treatment capacity at the existing STPs and proposed extension of sanitation services demonstrate the GVMC’s commitment to providing city-wide coverage. Additionally, the high turnout for the event reflected strong commitment from nongovernmental stakeholders to improving services. Numerous opportunities for quick wins to improve sanitation services were identified and discussed, with significant emphasis on improving household access to toilets and increasing the use and functionality of community toilets.\n\nBetter coordination within the GVMC is needed to improve knowledge and data sharing. The GVMC has a wealth of information and technical expertise for sanitation service provision, yet the assessment team found that this knowledge and data on sanitation schemes were located in different pockets within the municipal corporation. Myopic focus on expanding sewerage does not consider decentralized fecal sludge management. The GVMC’s ambitious agenda to expand coverage of UGD sewerage along with a rapid expansion of STP capacity is laudable. However, policy makers should be reminded that sewerage is only one option in a suite of alternatives for increasing sanitation services in urban areas. As witnessed by the GVMC’s current under performance, sewerage is difficult to maintain and services at this level are likely to remain out of the reach of hundreds of thousands of residents in slum areas for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe regulatory environment is weak. Overall, STP operators are the only regulated service\nproviders in the city. The AP-PCB regularly monitors wastewater entering the STPs and the quality of the treated effluent, as does the contractor charged with operating the STP on behalf of the GVMC. If effluent does not meet regulated standards, the AP-PCB notifies the GVMC, but no penalty or corrective action is enforced in practice. This lack of enforcement extends across\nviolations taking place throughout the SVC, the most egregious example being the unregulated\ndumping of raw fecal sludge by the septic tank emptiers. Gender and socio-economic bias remains a significant hurdle to achieving universal sanitation services. Data provided by the GVMC for community toilet facilities show a disproportionate number of facilities for men, including the new eToilets that are exclusively for males. Stakeholder interviews revealed that women do not regularly use community toilets, except to deposit used menstrual hygiene products, because of safety concerns or lack of cleanliness. Women also expressed equity issues with individual toilet use in their homes, as it is common for household toilets to be solely used by the men and for women to practice OD. This culturally sensitive practice contradicts the assertion that only residents of households without toilets defecate in the open, as a potentially large number of women living in households with toilets do not use them regularly. In these instances, the disposal of infant and children’s stools, often a female responsibility, is also likely not being performed in a safe and hygienic manner.\n\nFinancial investments are focused on new capital investments but ignore other life-cycle costs. The GVMC’s annual sanitation-related budget allocations and expenditures reflect the political focus on investing in large infrastructure. Funding comes from a number of different sources, including the JNNURM, RAY, and minor contributions from the Thirteenth Finance Commission. For 2015, the GVMC has budgeted INR 8.62 billion (US$135 million) for investment in sewerage and sanitation, yet the Department of Engineering estimates needing an additional INR 16 billion (US$251 million) to complete ongoing sewage treatment activities. In addition to a total disregard to low-tech fecal sludge management approaches, the O&M budget reveals hardly any money spent on repairing the sewerage drains (only INR 96,400 [US$1,500] in 2013) or clearing storm water drains and other such maintenance activities. Significant investments are needed to repair and renovate STPs and community toilets. Field observations noted that STP and community toilet O&M contractors were dissatisfied and frustrated with the funding allocated from the GVMC for operational expenditure (OpEx) and capital maintenance expenditure (CapManEx). OpEx is typically covered by lump-sum service contracts that do not accurately account for all daily expenditures for contractors (e.g., cleaning supplies for toilet facilities and fuel for generators at STPs). CapManEx funding, for items like replacement urinal doors or agitators for STP mixing chambers, is often delayed due to bureaucratic red tape and can take months to be dispersed, often delaying major repairs and taking vital systems offline that in turn reduce the level of services provided.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Opportunity: Building off the momentum from town hall meeting, the GVMC could organize and\nchair a regular meeting with civil society and the private sector to discuss sanitation.\nOpportunity: While investment should be made in long-term data management systems, the\ncurrent arrangements for the sanitation working group related to the CSP (in development) can be\nbetter leveraged for coordination across departments, including Engineering, Health, Urban\nCommunity Development, City Planning, and Revenue and Accounts, to move the CSP forward.\nJoint efforts should also be increased to improve systems and investment across the SVC. The\nGVMC could improve data sharing and coordination through improved IT solutions, such as\nnetwork or cloud-based storage and awareness-raising activities between different units working in\nthe sanitation sector.\nOpportunity: The GVMC should consider a range of fecal sludge treatment options including\ndecentralized treatment processes, condominial sewers, digesters, wetlands, and pond systems to\ncomplement the UGD network. Such technologies are urgently needed given the current practice of\ndumping waste directly into the environment. Per capita investments in fecal sludge management\nmay prove to be more cost effective than the STP, with immediate results for low-income residents.\nInvesting in a pilot project to install digesters in neighborhoods with a high ratio of septic tanks (i.e.,\nhighly frequented by vacuum trucks) would provide a tangible alternative to illegal dumping in the\nnear term.\nOpportunity: At a minimum, the GVMC should require members of the association of septic tank\nemptiers to keep basic records on their clients, the volume of sludge extracted, and locations of the\ntipped sludge. This data is critical to better quantify the scope of the dumping dilemma and design\noptions for decentralized fecal sludge management models mentioned above. Additional policies and regulations exist on the provision of independent sanitation facilities for\npublic transportation facilities, large commercial properties, hospitals, and industrial facilities, as\noutlined in the Code of Basic Requirements for Water Supply, Drainage, and Sanitation by the Bureau of\nIndian Standards. The GVMC and AP-PCB acknowledge that these standards exist and some\nlocations comply with them (e.g., the Four Points Sheraton Hotel maintains its own mini-STP).\nHowever, these facilities are not regulated or inspected by the GVMC or the AP-PCB, and no\ncomprehensive data set exists on the compliance of these facilities.\nOpportunity: Further research is needed to understand the full impact that gender plays in\nsanitation practices, particularly open defecation, in Visakhapatnam.\nThe assessment team also observed inequities in toilet access for the extreme poor. Sanitation in\nslums areas, both notified and non-notified, are a perennial challenge due to land tenure issues\nrelated to encroachment on vacant areas without permission. An estimated 195,000 households\ninhabit 711 notified slums in Visakhapatnam, many are in need of individual toilets. At least 33,500\nhouseholds do not have individual toilets, with almost 30,000 households reporting some practice of\nopen defecation. Field visits to the Indiranagar slum revealed that although the GVMC built houses\nfor the poor, they have not provided individual toilets. Most of the households complained of lack of\nspace to build the new toilets while many said that they cannot afford to build their own.\nOpportunity: The majority of OD in Visakhapatnam is believed to occur in slums. The city has the\nhighest rate of slum dwellers of any municipality in India, so tracking sanitation practices in these\nareas should be among the highest priorities for the GVMC. A comprehensive study is needed to\ndetermine the actual OD rates within Visakhapatnam and to identify the primary drivers that\nsupport this practice.",

      "Document Title": "Namibia Program Profile",
      "Key Findings": "Partnership with the private sector is critical for Namibia to reach the UNAIDS goal of 90-90-90. Assuming stable incidence and using current coverage estimates, Namibia will need to expand treatment coverage by 150 percent to reach an additional 180,000 Namibians, while continuing to sustain the 120,000 PLHIV currently on ART. Lessons learned in Namibia will inform future private sector partnerships and domestic resource mobilization to facilitate the achievement of this goal. Creating an enabling environment for collaboration is critical to supporting a partnership with the private sector. Governments in many sub-Saharan African countries are hesitant to work with the private health sect or, either because they are unaware of potential opportunities or because they are opposed to such engagement on principle. The Shops experience in Namibia demonstrated that such reluctance can be overcome and an enabling environment built through targeted advocacy. Several activities supported this success. As a neutral broker, SHOPS was able to engage both government and private sector stakeholders to begin dialogue and build trust between the two sectors. This dialogue was supported by high quality information, both on regional PPP experiences and potential opportunities specific to Namibia. \n\nThese efforts helped show both sectors how PPPs can be mutually beneficial and support the achievement of priority health goals. By identifying and supporting a pilot PPP opportunity with a high chance of success (Mister Sister), SHOPS built momentum and expertise in the health system to manage and implement PPPs. Corporate-NGO pilots demonstrate potential for commercializing NGO offerings, but additional investments in technical assistance are needed. Donors interested in stewarding successful NGO commercialization may need to encourage NGOs to consider revenue diversification strategies as PEPFAR transitions because they will require technical assistance related to these types of strategies. The SHOPS pilot found that NGOs require marketing capacity, pricing support, negotiation skills, and support for the development of monitoring and evaluation systems that meet the needs of both corporations and donors. Without the additional technical assistance, the pilots would not have been as successful and revenues would not have exceeded NGO services. Mobile clinics offer an important opportunity to expand access to testing, care, and treatment, but targeted demand creation in priority regions is necessary. With the majority of PLHIV living in remote areas, Namibia can benefit from innovative and cost-effective methods to reach these populations. Mobile clinics are strategically positioned to provide efficient and low cost health services on behalf of both government and private sector partners. However, expanding access to services through mobile clinics will require geographic targeting to reach vulnerable populations and behavior change campaigns to encourage health-seeking decisions and build demand for HIV services. \n\nWhile SHOPS ‘experience with Mister Sister was a successful Proffering some needed low cost health services (such as immunization, antenatal care, and treatment of acute illnesses) in hard-to-reach areas, it did not achieve high rates of HIV testing. This was likely due to the selection of regions for Mister Sister outreach. While the regions selected in partnership with the MoHSS were critical to expand access to services for the general population, they were not necessarily regions with the largest populations of PLHIV. Using existing systems and incentives can provide needed private sector data routinely and reliably. Before the SHOPS program, Namibia’s public and private sector systems operated completely independently of one another and, consequently, the private sector’s contribution to the national HIV response was not well known or fully integrated in national reports. To understand the impact of HIV services in the private sector, it is critical for clinicians to report on the types of services provided for patients and identified HIV indicators while protecting patient confidentiality. SHOPS supported activities that leveraged existing mechanisms to ensure sustainability of reporting. For example, working in partnership with the NAMAF provided Shops with access to data from all medical aid funds operating in Namibia.\n\n Through this partnership, SHOPS was able to access data on HIV service coverage such as testing, CD4 counts, viral load testing, male circumcisions, and ARV coverage through the private sector. While medical aid funds were unwilling to share data because of concerns about the use of those data, the NAMAF’s role in the industry and its commitment to assuring anonymity of shared data allowed SHOPS—and therefore, key partners such as the MoHSS and USAID—to have access to private sector data for key indicators.  Moreover, by incorporating VMMC reporting requirements with resupply of male circumcision kits, SHOPS was able to regularly collect these data from private health providers participating in McCelvey. Ultimately, the inclusion of the private sector data into national reporting provides a broader understanding of the HIV response and progress toward an AIDS-free generation. Working with private sector peer-supported networks provides opportunities to understand doctor-patient relationships and how they impact the demand for HIV services. Through the coordination of a network of private clinicians providing VMMC, SHOPS supported the sharing of lessons learned among providers relating to patient engagement. In particular for HIV services with limited demand—like VMMC—it was helpful for providers to share strategies about how to engage and educate patients on the benefits of services. The opportunity for these doctors to work together improved their approach to patients and supported the scale-up of VMMC.",

      "Key Findings": "Focused provider training, combined with demand creation, is a powerful tool for encouraging providers to introduce new clinical methods. The SHOPS trainings offered to private providers led to positive results in overcoming existing barriers for introducing new clinical methods, such as implants and IUDs, as well as utilizing ORS and zinc to combat childhood diarrhea. This training offers great potential, particularly given a recent policy change in Nigeria that now allows community health extension workers to provide LARCs—thus making it easier to expand access for women to these methods in underserved areas and demonstrating the government’s commitment to improving access to family planning. Moving forward, SHOPS is exploring how to incorporate this cadre into LARC trainings. When combined with increased demand generation efforts for these services, enhanced results are evident. With Nigeria’s low levels of contraceptive prevalence and family planning uptake, particularly for LARCs, demand generation is essential to sustain providers’ interest and their confidence in their skills to provide these new services and methods. As such, SHOPS increased individual-and facility-level demand generation efforts to reach clients in providers’ catchment areas, using a combination of community outreach and effective counseling. Use of SMS technology offers a cost-effective way of reinforcing training and increasing efficiencies in commodity logistics. Implementation has shown that use of SMS after training allows providers to ask questions and obtain added information regarding family planning service provision. \n\nEffective linkages were also made between PPMVs and zinc suppliers using SMS. Many PPMVs took advantage to request additional stock of zinc. In addition, during supportive supervision, inspectors were able to assess ORSand zinc stocks using their smartphones and immediately notify SHOPS of stockouts. Both of these channels allowed the distribution system to efficiently pinpoint providers in need of stock and immediately respond. Microfinance institutions, supported by DC credit guarantees, offer critical opportunities for smaller providers to access credit and expand their services. While DCA guarantees do not typically involve microfinance institutions, the DCA credit guarantee with AMfB demonstrated that these guarantees can facilitate impressive gains for small providers, especially community pharmacists who obtained loans from microfinance institutions. AMfB quickly reached its lending ceiling under the DCA agreement and continued strong lending to the health sector even without the guarantee. Through this mechanism, SHOPS demonstrated the value in working with financial intermediaries to extend credit to small providers, who are often not served due to their more limited borrowing needs, even by banks with a DCA guarantee.\n",

      "Document Title": "Tanzania Program Profile",
      "Key Findings": "A number of lessons were learned from the Shops program in Tanzania that can inform future private health sector development. Gathering and widely disseminating health information is fundamental for developing informed interventions and partnerships. Stakeholders from all levels and sectors of the health system require access to concise, accurate, and usable data to develop informed interventions and partnerships. Information at the national level is of little use if it does not reach those who can apply it at the local level. SHOPS made great strides in expanding access to data for decision making; the private sector assessment, facilitated stakeholders ‘dialogues, diagnostic directory, and policy and technical documents all contributed to Tanzania’s body of knowledge. SHOPS’s efforts to build a general consensus in developing these documents and widely disseminate the findings directly supported partnership building and improved access to essential HIV services. These early successes strongly suggest a need for continued efforts to ensure that information is packaged to promote partnerships and are distributed to public and private stakeholders at all levels of the health system. District-level public-private partnership can facilitate alliances when supported by a neutral broker. Public-private partnerships at the local level require open and transparent dialogue among public and private stakeholders. As evidenced by SHOPS’s efforts in Njombe and Dar es Salaam, a neutral broker can support the early stages of engagement by addressing the communication gap between the sectors, facilitating meetings, and ensuring that participants have access to necessary policies, guidance, and information on structuring partnerships.\n The private sector is an important source of health services that can be more effectively leveraged through greater involvement in local planning and funding processes. Public-private partnerships are more likely to be successful when clearly aligned with existing planning processes. Historically, Tanzania’s private health sector has been excluded from contributing to the annual comprehensive council health planning process and other local planning processes because district health authorities viewed PPPs as outside their regular mandate. Achieving and sustaining successful partnerships between the sectors require efforts to align incentives and jointly develop action plans and implementation approaches. Ongoing efforts should focus on better integrating the private sector in planning and funding cycles at the regional and district levels to ensure that all resources are adequately employed to meet district health goals. National policies and guidelines that formalize task sharing can lead to rapid increases in service coverage and improved patient outcomes. Tanzania has historically engaged in task sharing to address HRH shortages. These efforts were informal and did not systematically address human resource needs.\n Formal policies maximize potential gains from task sharing while legally protecting providers offering services outside their regular scope. SHOPS’s work in formalizing a scope of practice for Tanzania’s nurses and midwives generated consensus around the cadres ‘responsibilities and helped to focus and scaleup formal task-sharing activities. The new scope extended service coverage, broadened the reach of the health system to previously under-served areas, and reduced the burden on physicians and overwhelmed points of care. Improving HIV and AIDS patient outcomes at the facility level requires both provider capacity building efforts and targeted health systems strengthening interventions. PEPFAR 3.0, which aims to help achieve an AIDS-free generation by targeting the response to the epidemic, prioritizes scaling up facility-level provision of essential HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services. Capacity-building efforts, such as service delivery trainings and increasing the availability of data for decision making, are critical to improving the availability and quality of facility-level HIV service provision. However, rapid scale up of quality HIV services also requires additional interventions across multiple elements of the health system. For the private sector, this includes access to controlled public sector commodities such as ARVs, consistent and accurate reporting of health data, and strong referral and communication links between public and private providers. As SHOPS’s experience in Tanzania reveals, successfully harmonizing of multiple health systems areas can lead to rapid scale up of HIV service delivery and promote improved patient outcomes.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The proliferation of public–private partnerships (PPPs) for development as an answer to many public challenges calls for careful evaluation. To this end, tailored frameworks are fundamental for helping understand the PPPs’ impact and for guiding corrective adjustment. Scholars have developed frameworks focusing on the partners’ relationships, the order of effects, and the distinction between outputs and outcomes. To capture a PPP’s complexity and multiple linkages with its environment, we argue that a thorough evaluation should adopt a stakeholder-oriented approach and consider the costs and benefits that a PPP implies for them—especially as taxpayers’ money is (at least partly) involved. For this purpose, we build on a stakeholder-oriented evaluation framework from the nonprofit business partnership literature. In line with our broad evaluation conception, we extend it with the manifold ripple effects that PPPs for development have and include the time dimension for the links between different PPP stages and related outcomes to become clearer. Applying this framework to an illustrative case, we highlight important direct and especially indirect stakeholder outcomes, which a narrow evaluation would omit, point to the challenges involved in the evaluation endeavor, and identify interesting future research areas.",

The\nprivate sector will continue to have an important role in reaching zero cases in the current outbreak, as well as in helping the region recover, and public and private agencies alike should continue to look for partnership opportunities. There is also momentum now behind an agenda for change regarding how the global community will respond to outbreaks and epidemics in the future. The challenge is to translate this passion and commitment into public-private collaboration models that are better prepared to engage collectively in the next crisis. Firstly, to organize and build connections between incountry operators and the public sector: Public-private convening organizations, existing coalitions or other third-party groups, In-country operators, National governments. Secondly, to create expertise-based groups: Existing UN Clusters or groups, particularly in logistics\nand telecommunications, leading private vaccine, drug and diagnostic\nresearchers should convene with public health experts leading foundation or other convening organization, key organizations to step up as leaders, third-party groups, Regional public-sector organizations/unions. Thirdly, to improve information flow and the ability of greater private-sector contributors to connect to the response: The international public sector, The public and private sectors.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Clearly, there is much to be done to deliver on this call to action. The findings of this rapid multi-stakeholder review suggest that there is merit in - and widespread public-private support for – such a set of actions to be mobilised. Taken together, these various activities can be organised within an overall programme of work focused on framing what a new platform of public private cooperation with the international system should look like, in order to help countries and regions at risk from future epidemics such as Ebola. Consequently, second phase of effort can be envisaged. This\nwill mobilise the actions suggested above, with a collective aim\nof designing the precise coordination mechanism between Public and Private sectors at country level, and also the way the expertise-based groups should be organized at global level in the fields of drug discovery, supply chain, information flow management, communication and also a financial facility to help mitigate risk and provide quicker financial support on outbreak, through to innovations for public-private response and economic rebuild.\nThe World Economic Forum could help to facilitate such a design and scoping process over the coming months, presenting the concept at a high level meeting of public and private leaders at the Annual Meeting in Davos 2016. Making this vision a reality will require leadership from both the private and public sectors to take a close look at the lessons learned from the Ebola crisis to arrive at real, informed solutions for the future. Continued investment in this critical topic is\nimperative to ensure that stakeholders across varied sectors and regions can combat and protect against public health emergencies that threaten communities worldwide.",

      "Key Findings": "The Framework's Development-First Approach is a critical element of success. The report also noted that cities need support, approaches, and tools to successfully implement the framework and that focus should be on implementation from the start. Further lessons from this case study include:\n•\tAnticipate institutional challenges to sustain cities' internal capacity for climate change. \n•\tEngage and retain the right municipal staff. \n•\tFind advocates for urban resilience. \n•\tLeverage the value of working groups.\n•\tEngage the private sector with a distinct strategy. \n•\tTake advantage of opportunities to introduce climate considerations into decision making.\n•\tBuild ownership and accountability to ensure ongoing work on climate resilience. \n•\tDevelop modular components that can be applied to tailor tools. \n•\tUse decision-ready climate information\n•\tConsider short-term and long-term options in an adaption portfolio. \n•\tCreate peer learning opportunities to promote knowledge transfer--but ensure that resources are available to sustain momentum.\n•\tInvest in pilot selection\n•\tBuild flexible design and city-identified priorities into pilot projects. \n•\tComplement pilot activities by supporting local institutions and experts in an actively managed grant process.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Develop practical approaches to evaluate the net benefits or cost-effectiveness of adaptation\noptions. City officials generally understand the existing vulnerabilities in their infrastructure systems,\nbut they lack approaches for quantifying the costs of future, uncertain climate impacts and the\nbenefits of adaptation options to reduce those risks. Cities need better approaches, skills, and\ninformation that: (i) allow them to project the cost of future impacts from existing cost information\nand past events; (ii) apply climate information to account for uncertainty in the magnitude, frequency,\nand damage from future events, (iii) estimate the costs of adaptation options, and (iv) develop\nfinancial metrics, such as net present value, internal rate of return, or cost-effectiveness that can help\nthem select adaptation options.\n2. Translate climate projections into decision-ready information and disseminate it to cities.\nCollecting and interpreting information on future changes in climate remains one of the largest stumbling blocks to building urban resilience. Future efforts should continue to focus on helping\ncities: (i) identify authoritative climate information available for their region or city, (ii) translate data\non climate change into terms that relate to impacts, metrics, and thresholds that they understand, (iii)\napply this information consistently across municipal functions, and (iv) update data sources with new\ninformation as it comes available. Cities need better strategies for making robust decisions with\nimperfect climate information that may not provide enough resolution or certainty to fully inform\ndecisions. Information technologies, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Web-based\napplications, and data visualization tools, play an important role in helping cities access and interpret\nclimate information.\n3. Develop modular components to design tools that are tailored to cities’ own local contexts.\nCities need tools that are tailored to their own municipal decision-making processes. Rather than\ntrying to develop a generic one-size-fits-all approach, CRIS demonstrated the value of developing\nmodular tools that build on common resources and can be scaled to other contexts. These tools were\nbest suited to the pilots for which they were developed, but common components were developed\nthat were useful across tools. These components included climate indicators, climate information\nsummaries, climate stressor-asset relationships, adaptation option libraries, ranking systems, and\nadaptation option evaluation approaches. Instead of disseminating specific, tailored tools that do not\nscale well to other contexts, practitioners should focus on defining and sharing modular components\nthat can be combined to generate specific outputs that align with municipalities’ own decision-\nmaking processes.\n4. Link municipal-level adaptation strategies to provincial and national planning. Cities need to\nbetter leverage funding, resources, capacity, and planning at regional and national levels to support\nadaptation. Donors and practitioners should focus on making these linkages, and can encourage\ncollaboration through peer learning events and activities and by implementing programs that help\ncities and regional actors work together. This vertical collaboration can help mainstream climate\nissues into regional land and watershed management activities, and ensure consideration of urban\nissues as regional strategies are developed. Associations of municipalities are key allies that can help\npromote municipal issues at regional and national levels. Through peer learning opportunities, cities\nmay discover opportunities to cooperate on addressing common issues, increasing their impact at\nprovincial and national levels while improving attractiveness of projects to international funders.\n5. Target the private sector in urban climate resilience strategies. The CRIS program’s focus was\non building municipal capacity, but the private sector actors are also critical financers and developers\nof city infrastructure. Future programs should test the effectiveness of engaging the private sector as\na primary means of promoting urban resilience, and compare this approach with programs focused\non local governments. Practitioners and donors should also encourage better collaboration between\nmunicipalities and the private sector, through peer learning or by mainstreaming climate\nconsiderations into municipal oversight of private sector activities and services (e.g., permitting,\nenvironmental impact assessments, and consultant terms of reference). Municipalities should\ncontinue to explore innovative structures for financing resilient infrastructure through the private\nsector.",

      "Key Recommendations": "To officially close the event, Mrs. Fanny Kachale, Director of Reproductive Health at the Ministry of Health in Malawi expressed thanks for the opportunity to hold the meeting and to participate in the successful event. Adam Slote of USAID noted that going forward there is a need to work together to strengthen country ownership and develop national strategies and regulatory frameworks as well as further development of enterprise architecture and standards, and emphasizing interoperability. He encouraged attendees to work together to develop and implement a digital health learning agenda of: effectiveness at scale; cost-effectiveness; vertical health interventions; as well as cross-cutting health systems interventions. The following country teams and organizations received awards for categories voted on by attendees: Kenya and Angola for Best Country Team Presentations, Nigeria and Medic Mobile for Best Gallery Walk Booths, and Malawi for the country with Best Overall Participation. Government leadership working in collaboration with public and private stakeholders can enable a comprehensive and coordinated country digital health system and achieve economies of scale. Next steps include a discussion of potential future Africa-led meetings, including a potential high-level summit to establish national platforms for digital health through collaboration across ministries of health and science and technology, the private sector, regulators and entrepreneurs.",

      "Document Title": "Final Performance Evaluation and Sustainability Assessment of the Building Livelihoods and Trade (BLT) Activity",
      "Key Findings": "• Livelihoods \nFrom TMI almost 20 percent of graduates progress to university or further study – mostly observed among calligraphy graduates. In recognition of their skills and aptitude, the graduates from the calligraphy specialization are, normally, exempted from the first year of study for a Fine Arts degree at Kabul University  Just over half of the graduates remain in craft trades; many of the graduates work in fledgling businesses that are heavily reliant upon TM for support.  Through its wider activities in sector, TM has achieved $3.5 million of craft export sales on behalf of Afghan artisans and businesses, which did not exist before the project commenced its work. \n\n• Trade The TM business development department is currently working with 20 businesses – many in Murad Khane area.  Of these 20 businesses, 11 are government-registered, and 12 have been operating for two years or less.  The brand recognition and reputation of the TM name is successful in generating prestigious large one-off bespoke orders, e.g. a Saudi hotel commission; and repeat bulk orders from ethical traders in North America – e.g., Far and Wide and Bajalia jewelers. Typically, the orders for the international market are sourced by TM from businesses that are able to produce goods of the required quality. Overall TM has supported 15 businesses to export.\n\n• Quality\n TM has demonstrated its capacity to fulfill orders with a consistency and quality that meet the demands of the international market.  Quality of the product is often achieved at the expense of diversity of supply – only a relatively small number of craft (mostly jewelry) businesses in Afghanistan regularly work with TM to fulfill orders for the international market.  The quality of the TM graduates is generally mixed – it is reported that, although some have excellent craft skills, many graduates lack job-ready skills, business awareness, English-language skills, and computer literacy. \n\n• Rehabilitation\n TM transformed Murad Khane from a wasteland into an historical treasure.  The health and education services established by TM are highly valued by the community.  TM provided electricity supply, water pipes, and sanitation for residents, cleared and leveled the streets, and removed thousands of cubic meters of refuse and accumulated detritus from the area.  Residents noted that the water infrastructure is no longer functional and they have concerns about the maintenance of their homes and the communal drainage system. While TM accepts responsibility for cleaning the draining system and assisting with particular large repairs, it does not accept responsibility for other work.  About a quarter of families interviewed complained that TM works for those who have connections with the right people. TM clarified that they are not making promises of assistance; at a minimum, the evaluation team believes that these community responses point to some miscommunication. \n\n• Cost \nThe unit cost of TM training is currently very high: more than $20,000 per graduate for the three-year program.  The current cost base at TMI is unsustainable; staffing levels are high; training is inconsistent and not always of high quality, even in the specialist craft areas; three years of full-time study is too long and not suited to the requirements of many craft trades; and the awarding of a stipend to students, while being an excellent pro-poor policy, has not always been justifiable since several young people have been incentivized to study at TMI in the absence of any particular interest, ambition, or aptitude in handicrafts  An apprenticeship scheme with part-time attendance at TMI would be welcomed by the trades and the companies that the evaluation team consulted. \n\n• Gender \nAs almost all similar endeavors in Afghanistan, the BLT project has benefitted more male artisans and businesspeople than female artisans and business people. The evaluation team focused on the extent to which women participated and benefitted from the project.  TMI has, for the most part, been careful in its recruitment to maintain a female student population of at least 25 percent, though currently the proportion has fallen to below 20 percent. Women are concentrated in calligraphy, with several in jewelry but few women in the other trades and crafts.  There are eight female staff out of 57 TMI employees; five are teachers.  A small number of notably successful female businesses have been founded, e.g., Samira Kitman and her Muftah-e-Hunar Foundation (since 2010); and fledgling jewelry companies that are nurtured under the wing of TM. Independence from Donor Support Projections show TMI to be self-sustaining, funded by endowment / drawdown funding for at least the next ten years.  The current high cost base at TMI means that cost reduction measures must be implemented to ensure the viability of these sustainability projections.  TMI has the potential to be a ‘profit’ rather than a ‘cost’ center and thereby be in a stronger position to ensure sustainability after five-to-ten years.  Growth figures showing income generation from international sales require big capacity expansion from the supply chain.\n\n• Sustainable Public-Private Partnerships\nTM has built successful commercial relationships with several ethical traders in the UK and US, e.g., Kate Spade and Bajalia, and repeat orders are forthcoming.  Turquoise Mountain has developed a strong brand and reputation. It has collaborated on discrete projects with other companies in the sector, but its relationships with the Afghan government agencies responsible for international trade are less well-developed. Ambitious plans for a sector-wide ‘Brand Afghanistan’ are in their early stages of formulation.  The potential for developing PPPs through TM is evident from their past performance; TM has a strong track record in generating and increasing sales for the craft sector, with demonstrable year on year growth. \n\n• Viable Independent Businesses and Quality Jobs  \nA small number of enterprises with which TM collaborates are strongly business-savvy.  TM supports fledgling businesses (currently 20, both male and female), seven of which are, at the moment, in its ‘business incubator’ operation.  TM graduates’ business-ready skills are, though, somewhat weak.  The majority of international sales are brokered by TM, but 88 percent of TMI graduates find access to local markets without the intervention of TM\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "• The Board of Trustees (BOT) should conduct a thorough review of the quality of the programs and activities at the TMI so that they are delivered to the highest standard and in the most cost-effective manner, and so the skills of the graduates are more closely aligned to labor market needs. The review needs to assess the viability of TMI as a\nmixed-economy learning establishment with, for example, full- and part-time craft programs; short course delivery to businesses and the local community; postgraduate research; and international collaboration with vocational colleges, universities, and institutes of higher education.\n\n• The management at TMT and the BOT must ensure that ambitious plans for the commercial developments of the Trust, with the formation of an independent for-profit trading arm, do not become a distraction to the core purpose and principles upon which TMT was founded. In particular, TMI should be kept under constant scrutiny and review\nto ensure that the courses are suitable to prevailing market conditions, are of high quality, and are aligned to students’ and employers’ needs.\n\n• On the basis of TM’s declared aim to build a strong Afghan brand through internationa market recognition, the management should work with other NGOs and local Afghan agencies to play a greater role, collectively, in the quality assurance and collaborative marketing of the products of ‘Brand Afghanistan.’ TM is well-placed, through its reputation and independence, to authenticate and verify many of the indigenous arts and craft products and, in particular, gemstones. The formation of an independent laboratory for gemstone and materials testing and verification is an example of one tangible way in which TM could use its good offices for the greater good of Afghanistan trade.\n\n• TM should re-examine relationships and communication with the Murad Khane community, keeping in mind that the community is not static. Periodic efforts to update the community – both men and women – are important to containing the spread of misinformation and managing expectations. At the same time, it may be worth examining\nwhether favoritism affects relationships with the community and how it can be curtailed. TM might consider additional monitoring methods to ensure that resources are being fairly distributed.\n\n• TM should consider working with the community to draft written responsibilities so that it is clear what the institute will do to assist with the maintenance of structures, garbage collection, drainage, and other essential services, and for what the community and/or shura is responsible. Consulting the Ministry of Culture and Information in the process is also advised, as it currently has responsibility for historical city preservation.\n",

      "Key Findings": "SHOPS’ assistance built JAFPP systems to the point where they can operate sustainably however JAFPP leadership is not inclined toward sustainability.\n\nSHOPS increased demand for, access to, and quality of FP services with targeted clients, however, cultural norms and practices and norms that were not addressed through SHOPS are likely to have\ndiluted the results to effect of reducing fertility to slow population growth.\n\nDespite extensive awareness-raising by CHWs that increased acceptance of FP among low-income women, misconceptions about modern contraceptives remain pervasive.\n\nWhile demand-based interventions such as coupons, vouchers, CHW outreach and referral were not designed for financial sustainability of intervention, clinic purchases and renovations, capacity building and systems instituted within partnering organizations were designed to be maintained, used, and sustained\nby partners.\n\nSHOPS’ M&E plan did not have a documented theory of change, nor did it list assumptions upon which the design was based.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. If JAFPP sustainability is a priority for USAID, a Project Implementation Letter (PIL) or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) stating this agreement should be signed with JAFPP. \n2. Assistance to JAFPP should focus on clinic decentralization and facilitating clinics to operate as individual business units (profit centers).\n3. Financial assistance to JAFPP should be predicated on meeting performance targets, and funding should be provided in tranches conditional upon meeting benchmarks such as cost recovery targets. \n4. USAID should support market research to determine whether JAFPP could increase cost recovery and its client base by offering a wider range of medical services for families as a one- stop shop for all maternal and child health needs.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Implement gender policies with support from public and private partnerships.\n2. Build UNA/FCA capacity to integrate gender in the curriculum.\n3. Improve the effectiveness of program areas related to gender and leadership training, and engagement of agricultural school directors, teachers, NGO staff, and UNA/FCA faculty in the promotion of gender equity and institutionalization of gender education.\n4.

      "Key Findings": "• Approaches implemented under the DBTA/STAR programs: The most successful approaches toward strengthening the institutional, management, and human capacity of CSOs and local governments to deliver health services included mentorship and training, integration of HIV/AIDS and TB services at lower-level health facilities, establishment of community linkages for HIV/AIDS and TB services, a commodity-tracking system to reduce stock outs, and the strengthening of laboratory services.\n\n• The effect of transition: Transition of direct implementation of district-led healthcare management activities from the STARs projects to district grants through SDS was more difficult in STAR-EC and STAR-E. In these regions, SDS was preceded by the STAR projects, whereas in STAR-SW, SDS was launched together with the STAR project, resulting in better collaboration during early implementation.\n\n• Sustainability: The STAR program developed and strengthened management and technical structures at the local-government and health-facility levels.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. To strengthen DBTA capacity-building approaches, design future DBTA projects to address the strengthening of multiple components of the health system, since many factors affect technical assistance uptake.\n2. Clearly delineate roles, responsibilities, and programmatic parameters among multiple programs working in the same district to improve coordination and collaboration.\n3. Invest in developing the leadership capacity of existing health management committees (HMC) at the health-facility level to improve the quality assurance linkage between the health services and the communities served.\n4. In collaboration with the DBTA’s participating districts, establish and maintain a database to determine the extent of cost sharing among districts, with reference to DBTA interventions to improve long-term sustainability.\n5. Continue to support maintenance and utilization of the LQAS methodology for data collection, strategic planning, and improvement of programs.",

      "Key Findings": "U.S. agencies have sought to address causes of unaccompanied alien child (UAC) migration through recent programs, such as information campaigns to deter migration, developed in response to the migration increase and other long-standing efforts. The recent migration increase was likely triggered, according to U.S. officials, by several emergent factors such as the increased presence and sophistication of human smugglers (known as coyotes) and confusion over U.S. immigration policy. Officials also noted that certain persistent conditions such as violence and poverty have worsened in certain countries. In addition to long-standing efforts, such as U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) antipoverty programs, agencies have taken new actions. For example, Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-led investigative units have increasingly sought to disrupt human smuggling operations.",
      "Key Recommendations": "GAO recommends that DHS and State take steps to integrate evaluations into their planning for, and implementation of, future information campaigns intended to deter migration. GAO also recommends that DHS establish performance targets for its investigative units. DHS concurred with both recommendations, and State concurred with the one recommendation directed to it.",

Ventures with at least one-woman founder tend to report (slightly) higher revenue and employment levels. However, when it comes to attracting equity investment, they lag behind ventures with all-male founding teams; especially when they have prior entrepreneurial experience and when they work in the developed world. A closer look at the figures in this brief, however, suggests that the most problematic outcomes are found among ventures with all-women founding teams. These 325 ventures lag behind the other three categories when it comes to revenue and employment generation, and when it comes to attracting early-stage equity and debt financing. They also tend to launch ventures with less prior entrepreneurial experience and tend to have the hardest time getting into accelerator programs. To the extent that we believe there is promise in these ventures – along with the other ventures with at least one-woman founder – we must think about how to ensure that this promise is realized.",

      "Key Findings": "Technological public–private innovation networks, or TechPPINs, enable cooperation between public and private actors in a complex, dynamic, social, and interactive network structure. In this article, the literature on innovation networks is used to construct a conceptual framework that describes the structure and mechanism of interaction in technological public–private innovation networks. In the framework, innovation is created through a dynamic process of interaction between the public and private actors along the network lifecycle. In each stage of network lifecycle, social capital enables various interactions to occur and different modes and quantities of knowledge and technological resources to be exchanged and reinforced. Through a combination of the product lifecycle model and social network analysis, the structure of technological public-private innovation networks are examined at each stage of the lifecycle to reveal information about how the roles of public and private actors are embodied.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Prioritization and Likely Strategic Impacts\nTourism development can diversify Timor-Leste’s economy but cannot quickly provide significant local benefit unless\nlocal populations (and tourism officials) are up-skilled and conditioned to working in a tourist-friendly, service-driven\neconomy. Priority needs to be given to training. In addition, the scheduling of tourism development through national\nand regional master planning in a logical and strategic manner as access is improved needs to be considered. The regu-\nlation of tourism and enforcement of development conditions will need to be strengthened. Marketing is also a key\nstrategic need. Without it demand is unlikely to grow.\n\nGovernment needs to plan the development of tourism particularly in relation to compatible land uses, water manage-\nment, coastal zone management and the development of marine parks and protected areas. It should integrate tourism\nwithin the existing cultural and environmental constraints and opportunities.\n\nThe government must ensure that tourism development and environmental management are mutually supportive. It\nneeds to identify and help the private sector develop facilities to meet specific niche markets, particularly in eco-tour-\nism, nature and cultural tourism, and involve local populations in the identification and management of natural pro-\ntected areas set aside for eco-tourism.\n\nGovernment should facilitate efforts, at the national and district levels, to assess the likely overall impact of the eco-\nnomic, social and ecological aspects of tourism, to plan sustainable tourism and to develop both eco- and cultural tourism.\n\nVarious scenarios can be put forward for growth, depending on the extent to which the government commits to busi-\nness climate improvement, marketing, product development and environmental protection. The speed at which tour-\nism develops and job creation occurs will largely be determined by the growth of the accommodation sector. If the Pelican development goes ahead as planned for example, national room supply (and direct tourism jobs) will increase\nby 33%. However much infrastructure and marketing will be needed to attract investments to areas away from Dili\n\nGiven the constraints and lack of strategic focus in development and marketing, an annual expansion rate of 10-15%\nwould seem realistic. If strategic marketing, improved access, market research, training and targeted investor sourcing\ntakes place based around a themed/branded approach to development, the pace of growth could be accelerated con-\nsiderably.",

      "Key Findings": "• Nearly 5.3 million tons of CO2 were sequestered, as a result of IFACS-led activities to improve forest management and restore deforested areas\n• All 11 districts now have spatial plans incorporating recommendations from LEDS-based Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs)• All 11 districts now have operational MSFs, which are becoming lively and inclusive venues for multi-stakeholder collaboration and participation, thereby improving the transparency of land-use planning and management in the landscapes\n• 12,728 people (106% of the target value) are receiving economic benefits from LEDS activities promoted by IFACS in the landscapes\n• Five forest carbon finance concept notes that allow for investors to buy and save carbon offsets have been prepared for initiatives in Aceh (2), West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, and Papua\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "LESTARI and future development projects should seek to ensure SEA-LEDS and LCP recommendations are applied in focal district policies, programs and plans. This will require\na process wherein PPPs (such as the mid-term development plan or strategic program of district offices) are guided by the SEA-LEDS and LCP recommendations coming from the\nMSFs. Technical assistance should ensure that a proper and thorough methodology for this integration is developed by local district governments. Also important is a protocol for\ntransparent spatial planning monitoring that will aim to ensure adherence to SEA –LEDS recommendations. This is especially critical where spatial plans have already been ratified\nby a government decree. Even though areas may be under a land-use designation that could result in deforestation, the monitoring protocol can help to mitigate environmental\nimpact in line with SEA-LEDS recommendations. IFACS and future development projects can help by facilitating communication of these documents and processes at the national level to gain support from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Forestry and Ministry of Environment.",

      "Key Recommendations": "• Align project design with government planning cycles.\n• Design for coordination and synergy between inter-related projects.\n• Continue to support social welfare workforce development.\n• Formalize and expand support supervision activities.\n• The MGLSD should merge and harmonize the work of community-based child protection structures into a single structure of para social workers (PSW) with a functional identity",

      "Key Findings": "This chapter reviewed both macroeconomic data on the employment, output and growth of industrial sectors in the Egypt National Income Accounts, and information obtained through two surveys of key informants among economic and business experts and among owners and managers of businesses. A pattern emerged from both sources of information. The sectors that have made the largest percentage contribution to the growth of Egypt's GDP over the period 2011/2012 to 2012/2013 are the following: \n• Agriculture, Irrigation & Fishery\n• Manufacturing Industries\n• Primarily Other Manufacturing\n• Wholesale & Retail Trade\n• General Government\n• Construction & Building\n• Restaurants & Hotels (related to Tourism)\n• Communications\n• Transportation & Storage\n• Education, Health & Personal Services\n• Real Estate Activities\n• Social Solidarity\n• Brokerage & Subsidiary Activities\n• Real Estate Property\n• Electricity\n\nSectors expected by the panel of Egyptians knowledgeable about the economy as highly likely to make a significant contribution to growth of Egypt's economy in the intermediate future include the following:\n• Tourism\n• Manufacturing Industries – Others\n• Suez Canal (operations)\n• Agriculture, Irrigation & Fishing\n• Transportation & Storage\n• Construction & Building\n• Communications (telephone and IT services)\n• Electricity\n\nBased on these sources of information, and reviews of Government of Egypt priorities, we selected 11 sectors and subsectors as the focus of the study and further information gathering.These are:\n• Agriculture, Irrigation & Fishing\n• Oil & Gas Production (Mining)\n\nWithin Manufacturing Industries• Building Materials\n• Engineered Products\n• Food Processing\n• Textiles and Apparel\n• Electricity\n• Construction & Building\n• Transportation & Storage\n• Communications (telephone and ICT)\n• Tourism\n\nSectors named by respondents to the surveys as sectors with the most potential to affect economic growth, which are constrained by a lack of professional/technical skills, included: \n• Manufacturing\n• Agriculture\n• Tourism\n• Construction\n• Health\n• Communication & IT\n• Education\n• Oil & gas\n• Energy\n• Engineering\n• Transportation\n\nFour fields of university or technical college education appeared in numerous responses to different survey questions. For example the fields identified most frequently by business owners/managers who planned to expand their workforce in the next 12-24 months were:\n• Business (commerce, banking, marketing, accounting, management)\n• Engineering\n• Computer science\n• Natural science (physics, chemistry, biology, zoology, botany, astronomy)\n\nThese same fields appeared on virtually every inquiry about the skills required by businesses that have the potential to contribute to the growth of the Egyptian economy. The following chapters investigate institutions of the Egyptian higher education system to ascertain if those institutions have the capacity to meet this expressed need, and what they believe they are doing to meet that need.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Specifically needed in the near term are occupational forecasts commensurate with what have been reported as sectors of high-growth potential. This can be communicated to MOHE with the intention of promoting enrollment into those disciplines that would prepare students for careers in those fields. We encourage USAID to support further examinations by the MOHE into these areas that should:\n\n• Lead to the creation of new academic programs;\n• Place an increased emphasis on existing programs that do align with high-growth economic sectors;\n• Create greater alignment to industry needs by making required adjustments/modifications to those existing programs in high-growth sectors; and\n• Synchronize these efforts based on the data that are available in this report, plus any related information that is available from local sources such as the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) and the Ministry of Manpower & Migration (MOMM).",

Scaling‐up local activities into larger frameworks is especially challenging and project timelines are seen as inhibiting long‐term commitments.\n• Lacking are incentives for governments to replicate and scale‐up project‐based efforts, invest in domestic finance, and establish broad coalitions of diverse stakeholders to regulate land and forest use to reduce GHG emissions. \n• Projects are quite successful at engaging stakeholders and initiating implementation activities at local levels but there is a lack of incentive for in‐depth and sustained participation. \n• Direct drivers of forest land use change are well described, but the underlying causes of deforestation and forest degradation are not as well understood.\n",

      "Document Title": "Final Evaluation: African Strategies for Health Project",
      "Key Findings": "• Forty-eight percent of respondents said that ASH performance and results were good to excellent and 75 percent found something of positive value in this project. \n• The ASH project has met,or is on track to meet by the end of the project, all of the output targets identified by USAID. ASH has exceeded the target set for south-to-south dialogue.\n• ASH generated or followed up on 58 ideas with the USAID/ASH core technical team, out of which were produced a total of 62 reports, publications and materials with a focus on some health trends, constraints and solutions for improved African Health; \n• The mHealth compendia and related mHealth work is the most frequently cited product by respondents interviewed, with digital health cited by 22 percent of respondents to be ASH’s most important contribution toward increasing new knowledge through dissemination of lessons learned from country experiences. \n• In terms of reaching the project’s three IRs, 72 percent of the 50 activities analyzed for this report were designed to achieve IR 1 (expanding the body of knowledge or current trends constraints and solutions to improve health), 22 percent were used for IR 2 (advocacy and communications), and only 16 percent went toward strengthening African institutions. The project contributed new ideas and material through evaluations, special studies, publications and conferences (IR 1), supported consensus-building work on specific strategies and approaches through regional meetings and conferences and follow-up with regional partners and WHO/AFRO (IR 2), and advanced the work of a small number of regional African institutions and networks (IR 3) through focused technical assistance and management support. \n• Given the data on hand, it is not possible to draw a causal link between these results and changes in health status. Some of these results however, have contributed to strengthening some health systems, regional health networks such as Roll-Back Malaria (RBM), and regional norms and standards, and have focused attention on key health challenges such as pediatric TB. \n• Despite a slow start and extensive staffing challenges, the project carried out 133 activities over the four years. During the final year that will begin in September 2015, ASH plans to carry out 23 activities, for a life-of-contract total of 156 activities across the region. The Year 5 work plan was under review at the time of this evaluation.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The evaluation team has identified seven priority recommendations to increase the project’s impact in its final year. Recommendations for Year 5 of the ASH Project \n1. Accelerate widespread, multi-channel product dissemination of completed products and gather user satisfaction and end-use data to learn more about who uses the materials and why. Assure that key stakeholders like WHO/AFRO obtain findings and participate in teleconference meetings.\n 2. Complete the misoprostol, IPTp and iCCM, and SMS studies and channel those findings into well- defined, time-limited actions and results. Share the findings with key stakeholders.\n3. Support key strategic planning work currently underway at WHO/AFRO. Assure that ASH products and materials are widely disseminated to all of the WHO/AFRO clusters, including those that do not currently work with ASH. WHO has an electronic library and ASH should explore if this is an additional channel to disseminate the project’s research and tools.\n4. Prepare a white paper on mHealth that outlines next steps, possible partners and the investment in electronic infrastructure and systems architecture, including memory storage and system bandwidth that is required to move forward region-wide. The report should project the status of country planning for mHealth by the end of 2015. \n5. Document by the end of 2015 any increases in domestic resource mobilization associated or linked to ASH work, including any new private sector investments that may have followed the completion of private sector or mHealth country assessments or new investments by governments in pediatric TB. \n6. As follow-up to the ECOWAS conference in July 2015 in Burkina Faso, which included ASH work on urban health, use APHRC to identify and cost out key next steps to launch urban health services. Link APHRC with ECOWAS so they and other African organizations can conceptualize a plan for integrating better urban health planning across the region.\n7. Consistent with the revised PMP, document the use of ASH materials and institutional or policy changes and agreements reached by the end of the project.\n",

To retain the collaborative elements and partnerships, he believed that the district could play a pivotal role in initiating the meetings to plan and design the ongoing initiatives and determine the leadership and management oversight of these community mechanisms. The district letterhead, he remarked, would bring the profile and value for planning the sustainability initiatives. The mobile phone alerts through RapidSMS linking CHWs to nearby facilities for referral and real time information systems, needs to be sustained and integrated into the ongoing district health information system architecture.",

      "Document Title": "Value Chains for Rural Development Social and Gender Assessment ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Given the diversity of agricultural production in Southern Shan, a number of value chains could potentially benefit from interventions targeted to smallholder farmers in general and women specifically. The project selected coffee and soybean as the first two targeted value chains based on the following selection criteria:\n1. Total number of smallholders\n2. Potential profitability for smallholders (per acre)\n3. Market / commercialization potential\n4. Potential for private sector alliances\n5. Low barriers to entry / ease of entry\n6. Potential for value‐added\n•  Coffee\nThe soil and elevation of Shan State makes it suitable to grow good quality (Arabica) coffee.17 In 2010‐11, Shan State accounted for nearly 44% of the acreage sown for coffee in Myanmar (MNPED 2011), although at around 26,000 acres it is still a relatively small crop. From 2004‐05 to 2010‐11 the acreage devoted to coffee in Shan State grew an average 9.9% per year – slightly faster than the 8.8% average for rest of the country. According to the data from the International Coffee Association (ICO), the domestic coffee market in Myanmar is relatively small, but may have significant growth potential. Per capita consumption is less than one‐third that of Thailand and almost entirely consists of soluble coffee (ICO 2014). Rising incomes, plus increasing tourism, should see an increase in demand. Opportunities exist to export regionally and to Europe. Around 80% of Myanmar’s coffee is produced by smallholders (the average holding is less than 1 acre). It can be grown on slopes and with other crops (such as rubber) because it needs shade. Steps in farming coffee include harvesting, pulping, fermenting, washing, drying, hulling, cleaning, grading, sorting, storing, and transportation. Coffee is largely non‐perishable and can be transported easily. In general, distinct gender roles characterize activities related to coffee production, including postharvest handling and marketing. Overall, women may contribute up to 70% of the total labor involved in the production and processing of coffee beans. They are also key to the value‐added activities that ensure the quality of the coffee production such as careful harvesting and picking only ripe fruit; clean water and hygiene of the pulping, washing, and drying infrastructure; and good timing of the fermentation and drying process. The access to and control of resources and decision‐making, however, are predominantly the domain of men, and women are generally not empowered in these areas of coffee production. Title to coffee land is frequently registered in the name of the male head of household, leading to a perception of coffee as a “man’s crop”. Men also assume the management roles of trading and selling the coffee that, in turn, entitles them to control of the proceeds. Women work primarily as unpaid family labor. Access to related services such as technical training and extension, certification, finance, and market information are frequently targeted to male farmers or are more easily accessible by them due to time, mobility, and education constraints that affect women. Coffee is cultivated at higher elevations that, in the context of Shan State, include ethnic minority areas where the practice of customary land tenure prevails. The intent of the new land legislation, such as VFV Law, is to increase opportunities for private sector development of high‐value agricultural commodities in these upland areas. Statutory land use rights will not be granted to land held in customary tenure. Indigenous smallholders risk being displaced or they may be less able or willing to invest in adopting new technologies on land they may lose. In addition, coffee plantations take several years to mature, which can be particularly challenging in the context of insecure land tenure.\n\n•  Soybean\nThe greater and more regular rainfall of the Shan hills makes it suited to growing soybean. Soybean is one of Shan State’s largest crops (third behind paddy and maize in terms of acres sown). In 2010‐11, over 80% of Myanmar’s soybean acreage was in Shan State. Land devoted to soybean in Shan grew an average 3.4% from 2004‐5 to 2010‐11 – twice as fast as in the rest of the country. The demand for soybean has been largely driven by the growth in poultry production. Animal feed demand for soybean meal is growing and is primarily met by imports: \n• quality of local soybean cake is low; cannot replace imports entirely\n• but protein demand by local poultry and fishery is growing\n• full fat soymeal is produced by commercial feed mills\n\nDemand by soybean food processors(tofu, fermented soybean cake, etc.) is consistent but there is also small but growing demand for soy milk. There are informal trade flows reported to the People’s Republic of China and Thailand (Favre and Myint 2009). Soybean is produced by smallholders as well as mid‐size and large farms. Farmers involved in soybean also grow rice, maize, and niger. Some are also involved in pigeon peas and garlic (Winrock International, undated). The main harvest is during the monsoon18, so drying is a problem, as well as finding labor willing to work at that time (see below). Overall, input cost are relatively low for soybean compared to other crops (maize, rice, garlic) and margins for smallholders are higher than other crops. There is potential to introduce processors for making soybean oil. This can then be made into soybean cake with a screw press. Alternatively, using hexane it can be made into a soybean meal, which is higher in protein than cake and is better feed for poultry layers. But few millers do this and soybean meal is mostly imported. Another method is to add an enzyme to full fat soybean (beans heated, not crushed for oil) to produce meal. This is better for poultry broilers and is the largest meal source for commercial feed mills. But the enzyme is expensive (and imported). There is only one soybean mill and refinery in Taunggyi. Most mills in Taunggyi also process groundnuts from the Dry Zone for local wholesale market. Yields for smallholders could be improved with better practices. Favre and Myint (2009) found that in Shan State, on yar mye, soybean gross margins can be very low because of inefficient land preparation practices. However, in villages where improved cultivation practices have been adopted, soybean gross margins are comparable to groundnut. Potential exists for farmers to benefit from contract farming. Contract farming overcomes problems of access to finance and input use, but many farmers are unable to fully benefit from the model. Farmer cooperatives would have more bargaining power for negotiating contracts. Potential for gender‐specific interventions will depend on the production model targeted by the Value Chains project: large‐scale, commercial production that targets export markets or household‐based production. In fact, with soybean it is possible to have a blended model that combines export and domestic consumption19. With soybean, if a small portion of the harvest is kept for domestic consumption and further processing (for example, making tofu and soy milk), women in particular may benefit from improved storage facilities and more advanced processing techniques.\n\n• Cross‐cutting Recommendations for Gender and Social Inclusion in Value Chains for Rural Development\nThe following section looks at a range of gender issues related to value chain development, the constraints these can impose on women and opportunities for the Value Chains project to initiate pro‐active strategies for women’s empowerment as part of value chain development. Finally, it offerssome guidelinesfor working with rural women20. In rural households in Myanmar, both women and men are actively involved in agricultural production and related economic activities that are essential to support the well‐being of the household, although the specific roles, access to and control of resources and decision‐making are highly engendered. Women’s empowerment will result from increasing their access to and control of resources necessary for their livelihoods as well as strengthening their capacity and opportunities for decision‐making within the household and their communities. The following summarizes the “business case” and the “development case” for focusing training, technical assistance, and other support to strengthen women’s opportunities. Notwithstanding the legal, social, and cultural obstacles that face women, they will tend to increase their productivity and their capacity to contribute to the financial security of the households, as well as gain the confidence and skills to be more pro‐active in their relations within their households and their communities. \n\n\n",

      "Document Title": "USAID/India Health of the Urban Poor Program Final Evaluation Report",
      "Key Findings": "• Progress against mid-term recommendations:\nFindings: TA: HUP created state-level preparedness for the NUHM launch and developed a comprehensive primary health service framework. It realized the potential matrix delineated by the MTE, except for addressing intra-health coordination. However, the post-NUHM potential for an integrated and convergent urban health model—one which delineates the role of each stakeholder and the funding source for each planned intervention—could not be found in any state. HUP could not overcome the disinclination and the nascent capacities of the states to innovate beyond the NUHM guidelines. Private Public Partnerships (PPP): HUP could not move forward on the PPPs in the absence of interest within the governments to participate. The importance of the missed opportunity to build on what previously existed within the governments is now clear in light of the barriers being faced by the NUHM to recruit and retain health functionaries in the urban areas. Convergence: HUP facilitated the creation of convergent platforms. HUP incorporated water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) indicators into its monitoring plans and successfully integrated WASH components with the country’s supplementary nutrition program. There has been ample progress and realized outcomes on integration, as reflected by the WASH interventions in the Project Implementation Plans (PIP) of seven states. The coordination with other programs and stakeholders has however been minimal, limited to invitations to advocacy and dissemination workshops. Demonstration sites: HUP has systematically documented the capacity of state and municipal urban health systems, tracked beneficiary level indicators, and is in the process of completing the endline survey as recommended by the MTE. Although several research studies were carried out by HUP, operational research to determine meaningful Mahila Aarogya Samitis (MAS) incentives and impact assessment of demonstration sites have not been carried out.\n\n• Effectiveness of Scale-up Approaches\nFindings: Four of the five scale-up approaches have been incorporated into the NUHM framework. These include formation of women’s groups (MAS) at the community level, implementation of urban health and nutrition days (UHND), city health planning (CHP), and establishment of city coordination committees (CCC) as convergent platforms for implementing the NUHM. Similar structures at the ward level, the Ward Coordination Committees (WCC), were not adopted by the NUHM. The fifth approach, the Health Management Information System (HMIS), though customized for all eight HUP states has not been streamlined at the national level and disaggregated data for urban slums is not being collated and analyzed by the NUHM. In all, 4,267 (58% of target) MAS were formed, 118,148 (97%) UHNDs were held, eight (61%) CCCs were formed and 379 (1895%) CHPs were developed. \n\n• Effectiveness of Convergence\nFindings: HUP has facilitated the delineation of convergence processes, advocated for convergent platforms, and supported the formation of convergence structures at the state and city level. The convergence efforts of HUP resulted in WASH practices being adopted by the Health and Women and Child Development Departments. The model of point of use (POU) water testing and treatment developed by HUP has been adopted in seven states. Although the convergent actions were evidently strong at the community and the ward level (in the few locations where WCCs have been formed), there is an overall perception among the stakeholders that convergence has been initiated but not achieved at state and city level. HUP’s efforts to facilitate convergence with other urban development initiatives were limited.\n\n• Extent of policy influence\nFindings: The evaluation found that HUP’s TA has led to outcomes that include demonstration sites that informed the NUHM framework, advocacy that created an enabling environment for urban health, replication and scale up of urban health programming, a demand for TA, a high level of appreciation for the TA among HUP states, and increased allocation (122%) of funds to urban health. However, the evaluation also found that sustainable capacities are yet to be achieved at the state level. The challenges to influencing policy have been the states’ limited readiness, their low level of interest in urban programming, the short period of implementation, and the delayed launch of NUHM at the state level.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations for USAID\n1. Design a convergence mechanism such as pooled funding from USAID sources for programs seeking to address cross-cutting health issues which require multi-sectoral approaches and recruit regional hubs of high-powered TA teams, as opposed to central TA teams for such programs. Complement these teams with a small hand-holding team at the state level. Rationalize team size based on a preparedness analysis of states when introducing newer strategies or interventions to ensure ownership and results. \n2. Invest in documenting and disseminating HUP lessons, products, and models to reach a wider set of audience (state governments, non-health departments involved in urban development, organizations working with marginalized population, donors and other countries in the process of strengthening urban health programs). Important among the lessons that must be disseminated include: participation of men in urban health, convergence processes, and the need for a comprehensive urban health model. Some suggested avenues for dissemination are national and international conferences, regional workshops for disseminating process documentation within NUHM, physical as well as virtual resource centers linked to the NUHM website, and courses and curricula for developing urban health cadres. Another important avenue for investment is the HMIS software, as identified by the HUP team. \n3. Expand the scope of urban health in the medium term to demonstrate a model which includes comprehensive health services, disaster management, epidemic management, environmental health, solid waste management, community insurance models, and lifestyle issues. In the short term, advocate for a comprehensive urban services package, men’s health, and innovative models of primary health care delivery to overcome current gaps in human resources. Examples include primary health care models which are led by nurse practitioners, models managed by communities and models involving partnerships with the private sector (social franchising).\n 4. Consider avenues for supporting NUHM. Options include\n• Extend the program by 18 months until the Asian Development Bank TA takes over to ensure continued velocity of NUHM and support the maturation of a program that has been nurtured by USAID for over two decades. \n• Create HUP phase II with renewed objectives that address emerging challenges to the NUHM, health determinants, and urban development; in the interim period, engage with national and state level NUHM through a development partners’ forum to inform and advocate for the successes of HUP. \n• Start afresh; invest in the creation of large-scale private sector models which are co-funded by large municipal corporations to serve the urban vulnerable population, especially in mega cities. \n\nRecommendations for NUHM \n1. Ensure continued engagement of MAS and ASHAs through partnership with community-based organizations to carry out vulnerability assessment and community action; introduce mechanisms for formally identifying members as community volunteers and linking them to employment, entrepreneurial, insurance schemes, and development opportunities; develop revised norms for ASHA incentives and mechanisms and issue financial guidelines to MAS. \n2. Establish platforms to address men’s health issues such as substance abuse, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases e.g. the human immunodeficiency virus, and leverage men’s participation in community health and action. \n3. Consider incorporation of the WCC strategy within the NUHM framework as these can be leveraged for micro-planning, monitoring, and mobilizing services. \n4. Orient and advocate to states the flexibilities within the NUHM framework and encourage innovations by creating flexible funding mechanisms. \n5. Develop a customized behavior change communication strategy following identification of specific urban needs. The placement of Public Health Managers at the urban public health centers will accelerate this process. \n\nPhase out recommendations for HUP \n1. Document and disseminate the successes of vulnerability mapping and WCCs to create a demand. Document experiences as well as processes to ensure their utility and effective implementation. Process documents include: processes for forming MAS, conducting a UHND, managing WCCs, carrying out CHP, and convergent decision making. \n2. Delineate an exit strategy. Initiate institutional processes at GOI level for expanding public health center services/human resource norms and strengthening intradepartmental coordination. At the city level, the exit strategy must include the identification of a support agency to provide needs- based TA, NGO partners to support community processes, a city resource center equipped with a set of HUP products and process documents, and key multi-sectoral officials at the state level with which city teams could link.\n",

      "Key Findings": "In September 2013, both National University of Rwanda (NUR) and The Kigali Institute of Education (KIE) ceased to exist as legal entities, and the process of merging five public institutions into one university system was initiated. The revitalization and reformation of higher education is a complex process with a never-changing set of actors. Partnerships must be seen as a process, not a product, so that attention can always be given to the nurturing of the process. The nature of these partnerships must constantly be negotiated and renegotiated so that program goals, priorities, and responsibilities are clearly articulated, and space created for local interpretations and innovation. In spite of complications resulting from the merger, both partnerships have made substantial progress toward achieving its core objectives and intended outcomes and outputs. For URCE the greatest success has been in meeting its second and third objectives: better informed URCE’s institutional policies and practices through gender-focused research and capacity building and improved capacity to prepare teachers to address gender equity in the classroom through pedagogy, course content, and classroom management techniques. For CAVM the greatest success has been in meeting its first and second objectives: strengthened human and institutional capacity of UR in teaching and applied research in agricultural sciences promotion and support women's access to graduate education in agricultural sciences.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations for WLP Education and Agribusiness\n\n 1. University of Rwanda procurement regulations should be revised with an eye to expediency and efficiency. University and college financial systems and finance personnel must be flexible enough to accommodate the demands and requirements of various regional and international partners. However, donor support of University of Rwanda needs to be better coordinated. The Directorate of Planning and Development can play an instrumental role in building systems for more harmonized support, especially in financial management and reporting systems.\n2. Institutional support at various levels across the colleges and University must be secured and maintained. \n3. UR should collect gender-disaggregated data in whatever they do. This will help it to gauge its gender sensitivity in service delivery.\n4. Gains in institutional capacity have a better chance of being sustained with broad-base support from faculty, staff, and administration. While considerable effort has been made to earn buy-in from all faculty, staff, and administration from the outset, it must remain a priority. \n\nRecommendations for WLP-Education\n\n 1. The URCE partnership implementing team requested an extension of the partnership because there are critical activities pending due to the delay caused by the merger of universities into one university. For example, the outreach program has had little time for implementation. URCE would have benefited from seeing the implementation of all phases of the program: community mobilization, recruitment phase and follow-up. Also, the online platform is a pilot. Implementers and all stakeholders wish to see the outcome, and use lessons learned to improve the developed UR Connect platform. \n2. Mentoring content should be strengthened and more time allocated to the training component. In addition, mentors need motivation to do their job efficiently. They should make themselves known to the college community for students to access them.\n 3. When setting agendas for partnership activities, consider narrower scope of activities. \n4. Improved infrastructure can ensure sustainability of online learning. The government should provide electricity to most remote areas without access. \n5. TTCs are affiliated with URCE. There are should be strategies where URCE can foresee the mentoring and counseling activities. The support may not be monetary. Orientation and a template to track what they are doing may be enough to improve their overall performance. Mentors and counselors should be facilitated by URCE to achieve their goal. Although they are rendering services (recruiting, mentoring and counseling) to students, they are handicapped.\n\n Recommendations for WLP- Agribusiness\n\n 1. Growth of the program must be controlled to ensure quality. The program needs to grow strategically and incrementally. The College will be under pressure to grow the program quickly due to high demand and revenue generation potential. If the program grows too quickly for institutional capacity and, more especially, human resource capacity, the quality of the program will be severely compromised. \n2. A plan for faculty development that allows for more advanced training of its current human resources (lecturers, tutorial assistants, etc.) for higher-level degrees in the field of Agribusiness is crucial. While faculty and staff are pursuing more training, adequate highly-qualified teaching staff must be in place to continue teaching in the program. CAVM should consider regional recruitment for qualified teaching staff to fill in the gaps. Students, especially females, who are excelling in the program should be identified at the end of the first year, and receive extra support and leadership development opportunities. These women could be prepped to pursue doctoral programs abroad, perhaps through the Borlaug program.\n3. As Agribusiness grows in Rwanda, so will employment opportunities for those with appropriate qualifications. CAVM must remain competitive with the private sector at all levels. Teaching faculty must be ensured favorable working conditions, such as competitive wages, manageable teaching load and reduced commuting between campuses. The public sector must also remain competitive with the private sector. If not, graduates of the MSc Agribusiness who are working in the public sector will migrate to private sector companies, essentially resulting in a brain drain in the public sector. \n4. The program of study should be revised so that there are more practical classes in the first two semesters before students begin their 200 hours of internship. Courses such Strategic Management in Agribusiness, Agribusiness Value-Chain Management, and Agribusiness Marketing should be offered during Semester 1 and Semester 2. \n5. Maintaining engagement with the private sector is crucial to ensure that the quality of the program remains high. The relationship between CAVM and the advisory board must continue to be cultivated. The link among private sector, public sector, and the University is crucial to maintaining the quality and relevance of the Agribusiness program, as well as the nation’s development agenda. \n6. The internship and thesis should be integrated. This would raise the overall quality of the program. \n7. A gender specialist within the college is necessary. Ideally, gender specialists would be found on each campus. Resources must be spread across all five campuses. Existing gender committees at Nyagatre and Busgogo must be nurtured. Develop best practices or a handbook for how to integrate gender into the curriculum. \n8. Continued resources must be dedicated to building capacity in career development. The hiring of a career development specialist is a great start. This person will need support staff in order to succeed.\n\n",

Most of the grantees have not systematically monitored the income of the enterprises obtaining access to their financial services or to those of supported financial institutions. The grantee reporting and the project supervision reports presented by IFC contain hardly any information on sales growth or on job creation. The dearth of data is partly a result of the fact that, in spite of the importance of the employment aspect as stated in several Challenge documents, only two Grant Agreements included targets for employment growth. Both of these projects failed to achieve their job creation target. Although not explicitly mentioned in the list of Challenge objectives, some projects adopted a triple bottom line approach and try to achieve social and environmental goals.",

      "Document Title": "East Africa Trade Hub (EATH) 2009-2014: Final Evaluation Report",
      "Key Findings": "Banks and other financial institutions are often reluctant to lend to farmers and agribusinesses because of the perceived risk inherent in such activities, agriculture’s seasonal nature, uncontrollable weather-related events, product perishability and high market volatility of agricultural goods. EATH worked with the Kenya School of Monetary Studies (KSMS) to design a certificate in agricultural finance to strengthen human resource capacity in regional lending institutions, facilitate improved risk analysis/management policies and facilitate additional agricultural sector lending on a sustainable basis. While the majority of participants were drawn from commercial banks, other financial sector institutions, particularly microfinance institutions and agricultural savings and credit cooperatives, also benefitted from the training. EATH, therefore, enabled KSMS to strengthen its capacity building mandate by targeting financial sector institutions historically lacking in human resource capacity to undertake effectively best practice compliant agricultural lending activities. Most of the 204 graduates of the program are now key decision makers in EAC financial institutions.\nTheir presence within these institutions has enabled KSMS to continue to engage productively with the industry and promote progress towards improved lending practices. KSMS staff credit the EATH project with making a demonstrable contribution in terms of increased finance for agricultural sector activities, and with deepening the culture of good lending practices within a number of commercial finance institutions in the EAC and in some countries of Southern Africa. Though EATH support ended in 2012, the program’s strong reputation appears to have helped leverage follow-on funding from other donors (including GIZ and Financial Access). Other sustainability mechanisms that have allowed the program to operate effectively post-EATH include continued co-funding of participants by the school and major financial sector institutions, and demand-side resource leveraging through the KSMS alumni association. EATH also targeted strategic institutional-strengthening needs in the nascent East African insurance industry, particularly with regards to the development of urgently needed agricultural risk assessment and agricultural insurance products.\nTo build institutional capacity in the insurance industry and raise the level and penetration of viable agricultural insurance products across East Africa, EATH worked with the Kenya College of Insurance (KCI) to create a regional certificate of agricultural insurance. The program trained 142 financial and insurance professionals to design viable and affordable crop insurance vehicles and develop efficient claims procedures. Ultimately, the program is intended to mitigate effectively risk for farmers on a large scale, thereby increasing their ability to access financing and improve their nutritional status, and their production and family income outcomes. Since EATH support ended in 2012, at least 25 additional individuals have been trained, and KCI has partnered with the World Bank and the Kenya School of Monetary Studies to continue program activities. However, the certificate is currently offered only at the local campus in Nairobi, Kenya. It has not yet been established at educational/training institutions in other EAC countries which currently limits the replicability and scalability of the initiative.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. The EATH agricultural finance training programs reached large numbers of trainees and have leveraged in both cases spurred follow-on sponsorship support, as well as direct budgetary support from the sponsoring academic institutions – remarkable sustainability performance. The stakeholders interviewed clearly spoke to the high quality of the training courses proffered and their impact on developing a cadre of agricultural finance professionals ready and able to advocate for and implement innovative agricultural lending and agricultural insurance products and related risk analysis approaches. It might be worth exploring whether the current EATIH initiative, with its major investment leveraging and loan origination focus, might benefit from tapping into the organizational goodwill and alumni contact network created through these training programs, as it operationalizes its financial outreach strategy and prospects for top tier loan origination consultants. \n2. Major resource-leveraging risk mitigation benefits could be leveraged for EATIH stakeholders in key agricultural value chains; if effectively structured and disseminated crop insurance and warehouse receipts related financial products could be effectively applied. It may in this regard be worth exploring the opportunities and constraints (including current EAC legal/regulatory harmonization requirements) for developing/applying well-structured insurance instruments to leverage additional value chain finance for participants within one or more EATIH-supported agricultural sectors; and for in major agricultural finance product areas, such as crop insurance and credit enhancement mechanisms for WHRS instruments.\n",

Is the tool usable? How should we balance usability with the technical applications of the tool? How do we engage local communities so that they can continue to use and maintain the tool over time?\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "R1.1: USAID should continue current REDD+ work and consider expanding\nthroughout the coast, as described later in this report.\nR2.1: Next generation USAID climate change investments should place relatively\ngreater emphasis on community-wide participation and immediate direct\ncommunity economic benefits to ensure sustainability. This should be independent\nof REDD+ project sales.\nR2.2: Future USAID REDD+ efforts should review the Theory of Change to\nconsider how community members could enjoy greater immediate- and mid-term\nbenefits from the process of developing REDD+ projects through more local labor.\nR2.3: USAID should maintain support to Fondo Acción until community capacity\nis increased and some alternative sources of income (ASI) streams are sustainable.\nR2.4: Future REDD+ efforts should consider how to develop REDD+ projects of\nsufficient scale to attract investors, combining smaller communities, as was done by\nBIOREDD+.\nR2A.1: Support of Fondo Acción and future USAID support to community\nmanagement bodies should strive to make them capable of fully managing REDD+\nprograms.\nR2A.2: Future USAID projects working on REDD+ should build on years of\nUSAID investment in the coast and BIOREDD+ progress, linking consejos to help\nthe consejos and resguardos become a unified force for mutual learning and policy\ndialogue and to help achieve economies of scale.\nR2B.1: USAID should use its agreement with Fondo Acción to help develop the\ncommunity-wide support necessary to implement a REDD+ program. This will\nbecome particularly urgent as communities shift from pre-REDD+ to REDD+\nimplementation.\nR2B.2: If USAID should shift to a pseudo-REDD+ model with existing partners to\nprovide incentives for REDD+ behaviors, expanding understanding and\ncommitment to the full community will become urgent.\nR2C.1: Future USAID programs working on REDD+ should include proactive\napproaches to reach out to women and youth and design initiatives to tailor\nactivities to their needs, especially regarding economic opportunity.\n\nR2C.2: The approach should include an overall strategy grounded in Colombian\nREDD+ experience and implemented through annual gender work plans. Elements\ncould include economic empowerment, encouraging women to work in consulting\ncontracts and reaching out to community women.\n\nR2C.3: Economic indicatives aimed at women should be defined, as much as\npossible, by women. Some potential areas include ecotourism and forest promotion.\n\nR2C.4: When possible, have women consultants work in the field to spur women's\nparticipation.\nR2C.5: In general, REDD+ programs should try to have those who intervene in\ncommunities resemble their target communities. Communities are keen to work\nwith ethnically and culturally similar individuals. Women also appreciate working\nwith women.\n\nR2C.6: Once projects shift to implementation, it would be wise to make special\nefforts to reach out to youth as they will be the future resource stewards.\nR2D.1: One dimension of the Fondo Acción support should be to improve\nmanagement bodies’ systems to the point where they will increasingly be able to\nmanage REDD+ funds. Caution should be used to avoid rushing to this stage, as\nskill development must proceed with accountability.\nR2D.2: Likewise, in future REDD+ interventions, USAID should strive to assist\nmanagement bodies to be able to manage their own funds, but with a measured\npace, and beginning with accountability measures to contain corruption.\nR2F.1: Future REDD+\ninterventions should be designed to\nmove beyond business plans to\nactually produce benefits. This\nwould not only ensure communities\nactually benefit, with or without a\nsale, but would also demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the future\nREDD+ product to potential\ninvestors.\nR2F.2: In future REDD+ programs, and other USAID work, IPs that help initiate business should do so with\ncomplete planning and a firm commitment to enterprise sustainability, or at least\nbeing on a sustainable course before the project ends.\nR2F.3: As part of picking up the reins from BIOREDD+, Fondo Acción may want\nto review the ASI plans to ensure community and cross-community compatibility\nand that communities understand some of the more complex aspects of the\narrangements.\nR2F.4: Likewise, Fondo Acción should monitor local enterprises started by\nBIOREDD+ and help them to achieve sustainability.\nR2F.5: Future USAID REDD+ initiatives should learn from the impressive work of\nBIOREDD+ attracting GOC investment.\nR3.1: USAID should discuss the issue of community rights to carbon benefits with\nthe GOC vigorously and help build local constituencies among Pacific communities to retain their rights to benefit fully from the resources.\nR3.2: In the medium-term, future USAID-supported REDD+ initiatives should not\nplace total emphasis on obtaining external investment. Rather, they should use the\nmechanism to support conservation and development, while preparing communities\nfor REDD+ at a moderate pace, and funding conservation success.\nR3.3: The Mission could leverage the opportunities to provide economic incentives\nto communities that have met REDD+ requirements while they develop valuable\nexperience implementing the model and continue to market their carbon products\ninternationally.\nR3.4: Such a practice could help establish a critical mass of REDD+ activities to\nsupport scale up.\nR3.5: Such a community of REDD+ projects would provide an excellent laboratory\nfor testing the utility of REDD+ schemes as well as an opportunity to learn from\nthem. It could specify and validate the model, reduce learning cycle time, build\ncommon understanding, cut costs, improve impact, and influence the international\nREDD+ dialogue.\nR4.1: USAID should consider following BIOREDD+ with a REDD+ network to\nwork with the GOC to develop the Pacific coast as an uninterrupted REDD+\nreservoir.\nR4.2: This would require developing a scaling-up strategy and working closely with\nthe government.\nR4.3: Most likely, it would involve donor/GOC provided incentives, as if they were\nREDD+ investors, while the carbon market recovers to expand the number of\ncommunities pursuing REDD+ programs. Since the market is not now viable,\ndonors, the private sector, and GOC could fund such initiatives. Incentives could\nfeed the model, support development, and help transition to a time when the carbon\nmarket improves.\nR4.4: Participating communities would need to satisfy REDD+ standards to receive\nthe floor price.\nR4.5: Such a large-scale project could leverage earmarks (Afro-Colombian,\nBiodiversity, and Climate Change) into an integrated approach that could\ntransform the Pacific while supporting USAID transition and conserving critical\nbiodiversity and forest resources.\nR4.6: This is a no-regrets approach. If the market improves, it could provide an\nunprecedented boom in private sector investment. If the market remains sluggish,\nthe incentive approach will support focused development that sustainably combats\nclimate change.\nR4.7: Future REDD+ projects should build on the five REDD+ initiatives in the\nPacific by consciously linking REDD+-committed communities, possibly through an\ninformal association.\nR4.8: As long as the carbon market remains anemic, future scale-up efforts should\nmodify the approach used in BIOREDD+ to increase content directed at community\ndevelopment, and prioritize governance and economic development impacts over\ncompliance with REDD+ requirements. All must be accomplished; it is a question of\nphasing and priorities.\nR4.9: In so doing, the Mission should consider leading-edge scale-up methodologies\nto ensure success.\nR4.10: If USAID decides to continue with REDD+ work, it would be advisable to\ncarefully review prior Mission experience in the Pacific region regarding community participation to complement BIOREDD+ experience and develop an\noptimal model.\nR4.11: The Mission should validate that additional communities can leverage\nexisting NASA research and obtain carbon estimates at minor marginal cost.\nR4.12: USAID should consider developing a rigorous learning element to\ncomplement such a REDD+ scale up. It could specify and validate the model, reduce\nlearning cycle time, build common understanding, cut costs, and improve impact\nR4.13: If it could support a critical mass of REDD+ “learning laboratories,”\nUSAID/Colombia’s rigorous learning agenda could influence the international\nREDD+ dialogue, possibly in favor of community members.",

The project has established a strong partnership with local agencies for the implementation of its activities at the local level and has collaborated with international agencies for disseminating lessons learned to the national level. It is also too early to quantify the impact of the project intervention on environmental degradation, but the intervention is potentially rehabilitating degraded forestland. Advanced seedling production techniques will likely remain in the country, as seedlings produced by advanced techniques are recognized as well adapted and as having high survival rates. And lastly,  LRI reforestation and forest protection initiatives enhanced interaction and support between diverse communities and groups around a common issue.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Selecting reforestation sites by means of participatory land-use planning will enhance the sustainability of plantations and enhance plantation habitat connectivity. \n• Any opportunities to reduce the cost of setting up a plantation should be utilized, and potentially low-cost sites should be given priority for reforestation. .\n• Any opportunities to increase the survival rate of planted trees should be utilized. \n• Assessment and establishment of green firebreaks will contribute to fire prevention in the long term.\n",

There is some evidence of integration between HIV services and other services such as TB and family planning, however, this practice is far from universal.  \n\n• Second to HIV-related services, MNCH has been a program area for which positive trends are observed, with carryover benefits to PMTCT efforts. \n\n• The level of effort for MNCH and FP was particularly high for APHIAPlus Central/Eastern. \n\n• Traditional birth assistants continue to play a very prominent role in\ndelivery assistance, particularly in Western Kenya and Rift Valley. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. In designing future activities, narrow the technical scope for Result 3 (“increased use of quality health services, products and information”) and Result 4 (“social determinants of health”) to concentrate on maximizing synergies between the two work streams.\n2. For sustainability purposes, give strong consideration to positioning OVC efforts within the framework of “child protection” or “child-friendly social welfare.”\n3. Position future USAID-funded efforts addressing the social determinants of health as a platform that integrates health and social protection.\n4. Strengthen community capacity to sustain health strategies and outcomes, e.g., through community financing, or other self-sustaining mechanisms to maintain the functionality of community health units and/or by engaging critical household and community gatekeepers such as husbands/partners or religious and community leaders, to promote positive behavior change, service uptake, and service use.\n5. Redouble efforts to improve the quality of routine information collected (e.g., District Health Information System, HEI data).",

And while involving business isn’t a prerequisite for success, the business community’s support and expertise can greatly enhance the odds. Transformation of the education ecosystem is important to sustained improvement in education outcomes. Business leaders want to see improvements in inequality, poverty, and economic mobility, as well as a higher-skilled workforce. They also see education as both a cause of and a solution to these economic challenges, and through collective impact, they can multiply the effectiveness of their efforts.",

      "Key Findings": "Component 1: Efficient Use of On-Farm Water\n• By reducing loss due to seepage and increasing water flow rates, improved channels and tertiary watercourses have unquestionably increased the availability of irrigation water.\n• Factors largely outside of AKF/AKRSP’s control affected their ability to meet project objectives for irrigating 15,500 acres of land.\n• Work on tertiary watercourses progressed more slowly than anticipated largely due to the need for a much more intensive master planning exercise than originally anticipated and delays developing a grants manual and environmental documentation while USAID and AKF ironed out details of the cooperative agreement.\n\nComponent 2: Enhancing Productivity of High-Value Horticulture and Dairy Products\n• A large majority of beneficiaries attributed project interventions with increasing the quantities of agricultural and livestock products they produced and sold.\n\nComponent 3: Enhancing Processing and Marketing Capacity\n• AKRSP’s training in post-harvest practices seems to have been particularly effective in raising awareness of the value of proper grading, storage, and packaging practices.\n• Other than the Friday bazaar, which has been a particularly effective innovation for linking producers directly to consumers, AKRSP did not seem to focus much on linking producers to alternative markets.\n\nComponent 4: Creating an Enabling Environment for the Agricultural Sector to Grow\n• The enabling environment component has progressed slowly, largely because it has been difficult to engage policy makers and stakeholders.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. If AKF/AKRSP continues the irrigation infrastructure work, it needs to communicate better with affected communities and engage them more fully in planning.\n2. In future support to irrigation schemes, USAID must thoroughly understand the structure of traditional water rights and incorporate these rights in design and implementation from the start.\n3. To enhance prospects for sustainability, AKF/AKRSP should focus on building sustainable public or private sector technical service providers who can support greenhouses, orchards, nurseries, processing, and marketing.",

      "Key Findings": "Through extensive personal interviews, focus group discussions and a nationally representative survey organized around society's changing perceptions of corruption conducted in 9 parishes, this evaluation found strong internal evidence that USAID’s Project has succeeded in raising Jamaican awareness and fostering a national dialogue around corruption and integrity issues. It played a critically important role in fostering political transparency through the advocacy efforts of the Jamaican NGO implementing it – National Integrity Action (NIA) through recently enacted political party registration and campaign finance regulation legislation. Internationally, Transparency International‘s decision to make NIA the country’s official TI country chapter, selecting its Executive Director to serve on the team which developed TI’s new Strategy 2020 – serves as recognition of its ability to replicate its approach throughout the Caribbean.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Adapting the Project’s targeted outreach to schools, communities, churches, universities and youth groups, especially at-risk youth, would also help to recruit and train the next generation of anti- corruption champions. As specific legislative outcomes emerge from current debates, USAID is also encouraged to partner with other IDPs to supplement the approach of a future Jamaican project with technical assistance to address continued roadblocks in the political and justice spheres.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Leveraging its success, USAID should continue to facilitate importing and transporting liquefied natural gas.\n\n2. To support overhauling transmission networks, USAID should encourage and support implementation of the technical audits undertaken during EPP.\n\n3. USAID should consider supporting work on gas-related policies and agreements, subsidy targeting, amendments to the Electricity Act, and policies supporting improvements in DISCOs’ commercial operations.",

After a careful review of the complications and complexities of the CSR debate and distinct disciplinary deﬁnitions, the article turns to approach the problem of deﬁnition using the philosophy of science. It applies a scientiﬁc deﬁnitional approach of genus, differentia and species to arrive at a deﬁnition of CSR as international private business selfregulation. The article provides an overview of the implications of this deﬁnition on CSR as a ﬁeld of study, a management practice and an approach to improving the dialogue concerning the social contribution of business.",

      "Document Title": "Local Private Sector Partnerships: Assessing the State of Practice in USAID's Partnerships with Local Private Sector Actors",
      "Key Findings": "This assessment revealed several key messages from the current state of practice: Partnerships with local companies can deliver unique and significant value to collaborations with USAID. Depending on the context, USAID can derive distinct benefits from LPSPs that may be different from partnerships with multinational companies. Local partners offer access to local networks and, potentially, local investments. The value of their deep local knowledge was highlighted by nearly everyone interviewed for this paper, citing the particular benefits of “homegrown solutions” for local development challenges. Sometimes this local knowledge translated into a higher tolerance for risk, as exemplified in the Chocolate Tumaco partnership in Colombia. USAID colleagues also felt that local firms are often inextricably committed to the local market and that this connection can benefit Agency partnerships. “They are in it for the long run,” said a colleague. Flexibility and responsiveness were also mentioned — local partners are sometimes perceived as more accessible and more willing to change course mid-stream. Finally, and most critically, when local partners change their perspective on engagement around social issues, this can have a powerful and significant effect. “Our partnership woke up the [local] corporate world to the benefits of doing good,” said a colleague in Africa. Local companies also find distinct benefits to partnering with USAID. Colleagues reported that local partners appreciate USAID’s convening power — including its connections to international organizations and its government-to-government relationships — in ways that multinational companies may not. \nThis fact prompted one colleague to assert, “USAID has far more relevance [in this country] through convening power than through budget.” Local partners also value the Agency’s ability to connect them to international networks and expertise, and to act as a neutral party in complex situations. Local companies are motivated to invest in social and environmental issues for a variety of reasons; these reasons are best understood within the context of the local system. Local systems are likely to shape LPSPs to a greater extent than partnerships with international firms. Specifically, national politics and domestic economic issues can play a role in ways that may not be relevant for multinational partners. For example, a local company’s ties to certain politicians or political parties may have implications for partnerships with USAID. Local firms engage around social issues from a variety of perspectives. Local company partnerships can be analyzed along the spectrum from philanthropy to “shared value” approaches, but these terms may be nuanced in the local context. Most colleagues interviewed for this paper thought that these concepts were often less developed in the countries where USAID works. “Firms [here] are still learning why [social] investments are important,” said one colleague. Some colleagues saw a role for USAID in advising local firms on how to make Corporate Social Responsibility approaches more strategic. \nOthers saw value in encouraging local firms to consider more shared value approaches. “We want thought leaders in the local private sector,” said one colleague. Another added, “Our effort to engage [local companies] is a very significant opportunity to encourage them to be globally responsible.” USAID practitioners can draw upon a wealth of LPSP knowledge and experience that exists across the Agency. Although this paper is a first assessment and identifies emerging trends, Agency colleagues can explore multiple models and approaches that have been successful in a variety of contexts. Interviews identified how Missions are engaging local partners, through focusing on strong relationships, mapping the local private sector, and using annual program statements. Although the due diligence process for local partners can be challenging, many colleagues are drawing on local networks to assess partnering risk. Finally, Mission colleagues have found success in technical approaches such as embedding local partners into existing USAID activities, utilizing procurement instruments that would allow relatively small co-investments, asking implementing partners to manage local company relationships, and linking technical assistance to local partnerships.\n",

      "Key Findings": "Some colleagues saw a role for USAID in advising local firms on how to make Corporate Social Responsibility approaches more strategic. Others saw value in encouraging local firms to consider more shared value approaches. “We want thought leaders in the local private sector,” said one colleague. Another added, “Our effort to engage [local companies] is a very significant opportunity to encourage them to be globally responsible.” USAID practitioners can draw upon a wealth of LPSP knowledge and experience that exists across the Agency. Although this paper is a first assessment and identifies emerging trends, Agency colleagues can explore multiple models and approaches that have been successful in a variety of contexts. Interviews identified how Missions are engaging local partners, through focusing on strong relationships, mapping the local private sector, and using annual program statements. Although the due diligence process for local partners can be challenging, many colleagues are drawing on local networks to assess partnering risk. Finally, Mission colleagues have found success in technical approaches such as embedding local partners into existing USAID activities, utilizing procurement instruments that would allow relatively small co-investments, asking implementing partners to manage local company relationships, and linking technical assistance to local partnerships.",
      "Key Recommendations": "USAID Program Implementation and Design\n1. The team recommends that any future USAID C-LRA activity develop and implement a clear sustainability strategy for building the capacity of community structures to continue managing, maintaining, and operating ICT for community-based protection and EWS (and in particular the FM radios and HF radios).\n\nManagement:\n1. The team recommends USAID initiate an analysis on how to better implement community-based conflict recovery programs and activities as contributing and enabling parts of an overarching (but integrated) set of USG and USAID goals in the region.\n\nCoordination\n1. The team recommends that USAID consider a conceptualization of its C-LRA activities that more clearly delineates and de-conflicts competing or redundant programming between Invisible Children and USAID’s C-LRA programming.\n\nPerformance Monitoring\n1. The team recommends that any future refinement and redevelopment of USAID C-LRA activities include a rigorous, yet operationally flexible and responsive, monitoring and evaluation plan.\n\nStrategic Considerations\n1. At its heart, the LRA problem is nested within much broader security and development issues. Therefore any solution to this problem will require a more holistic, multi-sector approach.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Supporting manufacturers to better promote improved stoves and be able to produce much more for about 400,000 households living around the metropolitan area.\n\n2. The reasons that keep the users from changing energy sources are mainly the risks of explosion and funding. It is therefore recommended a second phase to build on the base of the project. This would be the opportunity to strengthen the media campaign with clear messages about the security measures and benefits of LPG. The communication on the safety aspects must be strengthened in order to dispel the fear that usually draws its origin from the lack of information. Messages should be clear and compelling as well to carry people to action.\n\n3. A team of technicians must be set up to reconcile and contextualize the various draft bills written until now. The bill must cover all aspects of the industry from importation, storage, transportation and sale. The bill must take into account the various components of the industry such as fire and safety, municipalities, TPTC, MDE, MCI, Ministry of Finances, BME, private sector representatives, etc.",

More companies have embraced the practice, now regularly disclosing their activities to investors and institutionalizing CSR by designating focused staff, developing a business case, integrating into planning and budgets, and by awareness of the need to act in a way that is sustainable as the company changes focus or location. Many companies have also created corporate foundations to manage CSR, which can review and evaluate activities independently of the corporation. The practice has become both strategic, through the development of guiding national working groups, and highly professionalized. A global industry now supports CSR development with training, guidelines, coordination, cooperation, and academic and professional credentials.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Conduct periodic opportunity mapping assessments to gain\na better understanding of opportunities to partner with local and international companies in individual country contexts.\n\n2. Encourage formal membership and participation of corporations engaged in health-related CSR at health sector fora that meet regularly.\n\n3. Engage in local business council meetings where groups of\ncompanies from various industries discuss issues related to doing business in that country, including CSR-related issues.\n\n4. Conduct study tours to health-focused CSR sites (e.g. a health\nclinic in a mining community) to learn how companies implement their existing initiatives and identify potential approaches and resources that could be leveraged.\n\n5. Organize a high-level private sector forum or roundtable to introduce USAID to corporations with in-country operations or to discuss a specific development challenge.\n\n6. Strengthen the organizational capacity of Ministries of Health\nand local organizations to engage with the private sector through coaching, mentoring, and on-the-job training on skills related to partnership design, implementation, and evaluation.",

      "Key Findings": "Farmers were linked to supermarkets and in 2013 and 2014 the two main supermarkets purchased $278,000 and $373,000 worth of vegetables from DAC supported farmers, with an increase in value of 34% between 2013 and 20141. From our beneficiary survey, farmers reported an average weekly income of $70 from the sale of vegetables, selling on average for 46 weeks in the years. Median income was $50; there was a large variation in income per beneficiary with 86% of farmers earning less than $2,700 per year ($60 per week). The more diligent and committed farmers earned higher incomes. This income data was supported by project data which suggests that farmers’ sales to Kmanek (the largest supermarket buyer) were on average around $1,000 in 2014.",
      "Key Recommendations": "If intending to support the commercialization of agriculture, projects should focus more on more commercially minded farmers and in strategic locations.\n\nProjects should also focus on producing crops that have some chance of being competitive in international markets because the domestic market is unable to absorb substantial amounts of additional production.\n\nFocusing on more commercially minded farmers in strategic locations will also make projects more cost effective, make logistics easier, and will have more chance of sustainability.\n\nThe DAC training model was a good one and should be adopted by other projects.\n\nThere is a need for better financial and economic analysis of enterprises, and across the value chain, so that donors, projects and the Government of Timor-Leste can make good investment decisions and promote the crops that have a sustainable market potential.",

However, the demand for services has not been met as there are vulnerable areas, and particular sub-groups of OVCs (e.g. children on farms and streets) that are still not being reached. The CFC approach is a holistic model of care that facilitates the provision of a range of services to meet the needs of the family. The key strengths of this approach are the identification of vulnerable households and service provision at household level.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• There needs to be a purposeful effort by future grantees, IPs and the GoB to target children with disabilities, children on farms, children on streets and children who have dropped out of school in future OVC programmes.\n• Programme strategies for including men and boys need to be implemented or strengthened by future grantees, IPs and the GoB where they do exist.\n• The GROW model demonstrates a lot of potential and can be strengthened through consolidating linkages with existing government economic and livelihood programmes; the selection of appropriate IGAs; and better mentoring support for IGAs.\n• The Aflateen programme must be adapted by grantees to ensure that the content is relevant to the needs and interests of the youth.\n• For programmes such as the YEP, grantees should ensure that linkages with appropriate government and private sector youth empowerment interventions.\n`",

      "Key Findings": "The findings point to important early lessons. Overall, we were heartened to see that the report highlights some promising examples of success, and leads us to believe that MSIs – in the right context, and set up well – can play an essential role in helping achieve results at greater scale for a broad cross-section of stakeholders. But the report also says loud and clear to proceed with caution, drawing on experiences of MSIs that did not live up to the bold ambitions of their founders. Moreover, as an additional warning to would-be funders of future MSIs, the GDI team found that (1) none of the profiled MSIs fully cover their costs, even after decades, and (2) most MSIs never close shop. Those considering forming or funding a new MSI, therefore, should expect to be in it for the long haul.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Several overarching key considerations emerged from this review:\n• Proceed with caution - setting up a multi-stakeholder initiative (MSI) is a high-risk venture.\n•  Consider alternatives - before launching an MSI, consider whether an altrnative, less costly, and less risky mechanism is better suited.\n• Timing is everything - even when an MSI is the most appropriate mechanism, carefully consider whether the right conditions are in place for a successful start-up.",

      "Key Findings": "The Alliance has faced many challenges. The program has been a significant management lift for the USAID Mission, as the review and rating of many rounds of proposals require dedicated time and resources from the technical teams. Many new businesses under the Millennium Alliance have required substantial mentoring and technical assistance, especially in monitoring and evaluation, where grantees have limited capacity to build the evidence base for attracting and retaining investors. A dearth of early stage domestic capital has also proved to be an impediment for the young businesses, inhibiting their large-scale impact. Further, enterprises that have brought new technology to BoP markets have struggled to establish reliable networks to service these markets since product maintenance will be unfamiliar for existing infrastructure.",

      "Key Findings": "The assessment found that USAID/Nepal has an opportunity to develop more vertically and horizontally coordinated and efficient agricultural supply chains, which will increase smallholder incomes. This would allow the Mission to achieve greater impact with its resources by leveraging and capitalizing on existing private sector efforts. Key areas for intervention include:\n• Strengthen relationships between farmers, intermediaries, processors and buyers to build trust. This will result in 1) clearer market signals that incentivize increasing and improving production, 2) more transparent transactions, 3) fairer pricing, and 4) more reliable supplies.\n• Facilitate investment in aggregation, storage, processing points and other supply chain infrastructure or services to 1) more efficiently link products with markets, 2) reduce post harvest losses and 3) stabilize prices and supply.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Given the private sector’s desire to integrate Nepalese farmers into commercial markets through stronger market linkages and improved supply chain infrastructure, the Team sees an opportunity for USAID to:\n• Collaborate with end market buyers, distributors, aggregators, processors and exporters interested in fostering more efficient and stronger agricultural markets.\n• Engage private sector actors to facilitate investments in aggregation solutions at national, district, and VDC levels.\n• Reinforce healthy supply chain development by strengthening the agriculture market and services ecosystem through private sector collaboration that supports the deployment of more diverse agriculture finance offerings, modern agriculture technologies, and ICT for agriculture solutions.",

      "Key Findings": "Approved in August 2013 under CMU Decree #739, the PPP concept sent a clear signal to government and the private sector that PPPs would be a valid mechanism for procuring infrastructure and public services in Ukraine.\n\nP3DP played a significant role in the establishment of MOEDT’s PPP Unit, which provides guidance and support for PPP implementation in Ukraine.\n\nA baseline survey in 2011 and follow-up surveys in 2014 and 2015 showed that knowledge of PPPs in PPP pilot cities increased significantly over the life of the Program.\n\nP3DP served as transaction advisor for two successful PPPs in sports & recreation (2013) and alternative heating with biofuel (2014).\n\nP3DP played an important part in implementing USAID’s Global Climate Change and Development Strategy in Ukraine.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To further PPP development in Ukraine, P3DP recommends that the government, donors, development institutions, NGOs and others with the necessary resources consider the following as they develop strategies for promoting PPP development:\n\n- Maximizing the use of contracting out for services, including those of local small and medium-sized businesses. By bringing in the private sector through management or output-based contracts in the short term, even in cases where government directly finances urgent infrastructure construction (such as roads), both the government and private sector will develop productive working relationships.\n\n- Continuing to build the legislative and institutional framework for PPPs. This will enable the private sector to engage in longer-term projects more quickly once Ukraine has achieved stability, both politically and in terms of renewed conflict with Russia.\n\n- Strengthen PPP institutions, including PIEC, working groups, and PPP programs at business education institutions. These should include governmental bodies as well as major developmental players, including the World Bank Group and USAID.\n\n- Rethinking the role, functions, and structure of the PPP Unit to lead PPP policy and development going forward.\n\n- Explore role of private sector through PPPs for any area where Ukraine faces challenges.\n\n- Maximizing replicable PPPs, for example, in using biofuel as a substitute for Russian natural gas for heating.\n\n- Providing guarantees for government payments to private sector partners (for well-vetted, sound, and economically beneficial PPP projects) to increase the willingness of private operators to engage in PPPs.\n\n- Addressing social needs, such as healthcare or refugee resettlement services for IDPs, through PPP-like arrangements with NGOs.\n\n- Developing media capacity for better coverage of PPP-related issues in the press, as well as include strategic communications in PPP training programs for officials and other practitioners.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Representation of impact enterprises across sectors is weak. Barring agriculture, value chains in most sectors with impact enterprise presence are shallow. There are some critical white spaces, highlighting significant opportunity for profitable and innovative models.\n\n2. Transfer of knowledge and resources through South-South collaboration can foster entrepreneurship in East Africa and stimulate further innovation.\n\n3. For the most part, entrepreneurial activity in East Africa is restricted to Kenya. Concerted efforts to build a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem will eventually support a larger number of innovation focused enterprises across the region.",

      "Document Title": "The Landscape for Impact Investing in West Africa: Understanding the current status, trends, opportunities, and challenges",
      "Key Findings": "This report observes the impacts of investment markets in the West African region. The report contains an overview of the West African region, followed by three chapters regarding Senegal, Nigeria, and Ghana. The report also includes information about investment landscapes in Sierra Leone, Cote d’Ivoire, Togo, and Benin. Perceived barriers to deploying impact capital in the region is described.  The report highlights the key perceived opportunities for investment, including the key sectors of energy, financial services, and agriculture.\n\nThe authors identify the need to inform the global community on investment potentials and impacts in West Africa. Because a majority of investment comes from Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), the largest source of impact capital in the region is foreign governments. Within the DFIs, the majority of direct capital deployed is from global and regional participants. Additionally, the study identifies the following perceived barriers to deploying impact capital: \n\n• Investment readiness of target investees due to lack of appropriate personnel, as well as lack of sound financial and business structures that make it difficult for investors to estimate potential future profitability and investment value.\n• Difficulty sourcing capital. Local funders find it difficult to secure domestic financing and instead rely on foreign capital from DFIs. \n• Difficulty exiting equity investments, due to shallow financial markets. \n• Macroeconomic and political instability.\n• Unpredictable regulation. Few regulatory barriers exist in the region for investments, including a general lack of clear, up-to-date legislation and about the difficulties in predicting policy direction. \n•  Perception challenges. The term 'impact investing' is perceived by local fund managers to imply low returns on investment and is more closely aligned with philanthropy. \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Interviews revealed the following as promising interventions: \n• Raise awareness of impact investment. Many investors in West Africa either do not know what impact investing is or see it as a new kind of philanthropy—in both cases, the term “impact investment” is not greeted with excitement for those looking to commit money to the region. Raising awareness would help this. This could come in the form of publishing and disseminating more research, developing stronger networks among impact investors to build collective visibility, and outreach by impact investors to commercial investors.  \n• Capitalize on African high net-worth individuals and corporations. Related to the above, it is particularly important to reach out to and engage African HNWIs as new sources of funding. Interviews indicated that there are several African HNWIs looking to direct their wealth to more impactful ends.89 Now is the time to engage them on the potential of impact investing to represent a new wave of African philanthropy that is at once impactful and financially sustainable. At the same time, there are many large corporations emerging in the region that could utilize impact investments to develop their supply chains. Interviewees mentioned that, like HNWIs, such corporations lack awareness and understanding of impact investing. \n• Strengthen the ecosystem of incubators and accelerators. One of the most consistent messages from investors was that it was extremely difficult to find investable enterprises, while one of the most consistent messages from incubators was that they struggled to engage investors. This is peculiar, since incubators provide the very types of business support that would help build a healthy pipeline of investable enterprises for investors. Clearly, there is a gap in collaboration. In order to bridge this gap, two things need to happen: the incubator ecosystem needs to grow and linkages between investors and incubators need to strengthen. \nTo accomplish these goals, impact investors can: \n• Develop relationships with individual incubators to help them understand the types of enterprises they are looking for, the indicators that are most important in deciding whether to invest, and likely future investment pipeline needs. \n• Invest in incubators so that incubator numbers and capacities grow. \n• Work with incubators to build a stronger network of support associations that link investors and investees and engage governments. \n• Educate and engage enterprises on the value of equity through local partnerships. Investors were generally of the opinion that equity investments were more effective at driving enterprise growth than debt, since equity allowed investors to take a more “hands-on” approach and use their expertise to guide the business—often through taking a board seat. However, West African enterprises are hesitant to accept equity investments due to a fear of losing control of their businesses. One of the ways to counteract this is to establish a local presence. interviews indicated that business owners and managers value in-person contact, and are far more likely to trust investors that are both present in and known to their communities. For investors not able to do this, finding local partners or investing indirectly through local fund managers is also a viable option. Those that already have a local presence should, of course, continue to emphasize their role as partners to the enterprises around them. \n• Develop a track record of success through more consistent measurement. It is difficult for investors to align on a common set of metrics and impact indicators, not least because they deal with a variety of different enterprises with different impact profiles. Still, better and more consistent internal measurement, coupled with external reporting, can help to identify drivers of both success and failure, ultimately equipping the industry with a clearer growth path. Greater use of MIS could ease the process of tracking internal metrics and make it easier to publicize results. It is an interesting time for West Africa. A track record of fast economic growth, coupled with the expectation that such growth will continue, has placed it firmly on the agenda of many international and local investors. Impact investors have recently started to turn their attention to the region; though the industry is currently small, there are large opportunities for it to expand. For these opportunities to be realized, however, timely and coordinated effort is needed across the impacting investing industry.\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. If and when USAID/Pakistan engages local partners, it should do so slowly with relatively modest projects where the negative consequences associated with up front learning are small.\n\n2. USAID/Pakistan should adapt the value of exports indicator to reflect a more meaningful measure of enhanced access to export markets.\n\n3. If USAID/Pakistan intends to continue supporting agricultural value chain development, it should consider continuing support to at least some of the more promising TAP-supported value chains and beneficiaries to give beneficiaries the additional technical assistance necessary to cement the lessons they have learned and address new challenges that arise as they gain experience with new technologies and practices.\n\n4. If USAID/Pakistan wishes to continue supporting the meat sector with a focus on developing export markets, it needs to take a more holistic approach.\n\n5. To improve prospects for sustainability, USAID/Pakistan should require implementing partners to develop sustainability plans during the design phase, review the plans periodically to determine whether sustainability hypotheses are valid, and adapt implementation as necessary if the hypotheses do not hold true.\n6. When building and/or strengthening institutions is an important component of a sustainability strategy, it needs to start early in the project so the institutions are engaged, strong, and sustainable.",

      "Document Title": "Targeted States High Impact Project (TSHIP) End-of-Project Evaluation Final Report",
      "Key Findings": "While service delivery was found to have improved at the TSHIP-supported sites visited by the Evaluation Team, TSHIP was seriously hindered in achieving its expected health outcomes during the six years of the project because the project’s critical assumptions failed to hold during implementation and because some indicators require longer timelines to see an improvement.  Also, while TSHIP ushered in new progressive health policies such as minimum coverage packages, they are still at too early a stage of implementation to be evaluated and to have delivered measurable health outcomes.   The assumptions which have thus far been hard for the Government of Nigeria (GON) and LGAs to meet included the ability and willingness of the two states to provide adequate staff levels at the state, local government, and health facility levels; provide sufficient funding levels for high-quality service delivery; provide adequate commodities; and a functioning health management information system (HMIS).  TSHIP met or surpassed expected outputs, with especially high praise for the project’s community work and building effective community networks.   The community work has laid the groundwork for the local governments to strengthen health services in the two states.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Follow-on activities should be designed in collaboration with the key stakeholders (state and local governments and civil society) in the two states.  The Focus State Strategy should be continued as a strategic approach, not a project approach.  Future health projects should have gender strategies and work plans integrated into project design.  Ward Development Committees proved to be a valuable asset and a powerful tool for TSHIP and the entire health system strengthening/development process.",

      "Key Findings": "1. Participatory processes and facilitated dialogue can improve policy and support the efficient use of scarce public resources for poverty reduction by introducing result-based evidence into the decision-making process.\n2. The development of policies and project interventions based on multidimensional analyses of production systems is essential for optimizing the impact of public and private investments. Such analyses enable efforts to optimize outcomes across multiple categories of impact (economic, environmental, social) and over time.\n3. Partnership between research institutes and development agencies rooted in an “intent to influence” holds the potential to help both be more effective – by contributing to public policies based on technical and scientific evidence, research institutes can leverage the public goods they create through their research for broad impact; while development agencies whose projects may have limited numbers of direct participants can achieve “lower intensity” impact at a much larger scale through more inclusive policies.\n4. Facilitation of multi-stakeholder engagement in the development and adoption of sectoral plans was effective in this case due to the ability of the facilitation agents, the perception of their credibility among participants in the process, their status as disinterested actors, and their ability to support and inform decision-making through the provision of result-based evidence.\n5. New types of institutional organization and governance structures may be needed to develop strategies for adequately managing the risks and threats related to climatic variability and climate change, which will affect crop production in coffee-growing zones.\n6. The most effective interventions in the coffee sector will be customized for different growers based on farmer typology and for different\ngeographies based on agroecological, economic, and social variables.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Pair field-based operations with “research-for-influence” partnerships to position development agencies to contribute to broad-based impact even at a time of declining investment in the sector.\n2. Reflect the differences between farmer types in their efforts to maximize net income of farmers in the coffee sector in public policies aiming to reduce poverty. Effective interventions will be adapted to the conditions of each farmer group.\n3. Environmental niches need to be identified and joined with specialty\nmarketing niches, taking advantage of the “denomination of origin”\nand the international market’s recognition of Nariño’s high-quality\ncoffee, while seeking the maximum expression in the cup-of-coffee\nprofile with respect to the relationship between variety +\nenvironmental offer + postharvest handling + markets.\n4.Public policies aiming at poverty reduction in the coffee sector should reflect the differences between farmer types in their efforts to maximize net income of farmers in the coffee sector. Effective interventions will be adapted to the conditions of each farmer group.\n5.In all scenarios involving changes in land-use patterns, careful consideration must be given to ecological impacts, especially in the case of transition away from shade-grown coffee to annual or short-cycle crops grown in full exposure to the sun, and in the case of any crops planted on steep hillsides.\n6.It is essential to generate local capacities focused on achieving high quality in aspects such as postharvesting, ideal fermentation times according to geographic location, drying infrastructure, and storage. This could be catalyzed by implementing more inclusive business models that facilitate communication with the private sector, both for high-quality and mass-produced coffees, as is done for other sectors such as fruits and vegetables.\n",

Under the best of circumstances capacity building and behavior change are challenging to measure; the dynamic, experimental, adaptive approach of PAP, and the multiple behaviors it intended to change (water, energy and solid waste) among populations who were sometimes exposed to multiple campaigns, present a large number of variables that further challenges measurement for the purpose of comparison and attribution. Nonetheless, the evaluation uncovers evidence, lessons, and practices that can be incorporated into future programs for social marketing and energy, water, and waste management.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Effectiveness:\nPrior to identifying counterparts (government, municipalities, and utilities) and providing assistance, ensure agreement on priorities, strategies, and implementation mechanisms, and clearly articulating expectations and roles. \n\nSustainability:\nTo the extent possible, support JSMC to expand social marketing in Jordan (whether for energy conservation/savings or for other causes of social change) in order to leverage the investment made in its technical and management capabilities.\n\nLearning: \nFund the completion of Aqaba and Amman EDCO websites and replace or repair the malfunctioning solid waste equipment in Irbid.\n",

The value chains—coffee, sesame, chickpea, honey, wheat, and maize—were identified for their potential to improve both food security and incomes. The main goal of AGP is to sustainably reduce poverty and hunger and enhance economic growth. These goals are achieved by improving the productivity and competitiveness of value chains that offer jobs and income opportunities for rural households. The project goals were aligned with the AGP goals and the overarching Feed the Future Initiative (FtF) goal, “to sustainably reduce poverty and hunger.”",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. As quick as is practically possible, we recommend that the various on-going studies should be completed, particularly those focusing on identifying candidate genes, and published in refereed journals.\n\n2. It is critical that the project scientists pull together the results of studies to clearly validate and confirm the most significant candidate genes for heat tolerance.\n\n3. The project needs to determine what priority it will give to the formation, improvement, and testing of synthetics as OPVs.\n\n4. For this we recommend that number of entries particularly for Stage–III and MLT should be same for two seasons/two years.\n\n5. We strongly recommend that the short-term training courses be continued so that additional researchers/technical staff can benefit.",

      "Key Findings": "The article presents an analysis of trends in organizational, industrial and infrastructural development of innovative territorial clusters (ITC) in the Russian Federation. Parameters and characteristics of subsidies allocated from various sources for these purposes in 2013-2015 are disclosed. The study of the conducted ITC’s support policies reflects the concentration of clusters’ control levers by the regional authorities, that causes certain risks of clustering processes containment in general. The spatial and temporal unevenness of clusters’ organizational development process, the instability of their financial support and strengthening the vertical channels of influence that could give rise to corruption, stagnation and ignoring the views of cluster participants when making strategic decisions are revealed. The authors reveal the necessity of conceptual enrichment of the methods and tools of formation and implementation of ITC’s strategies aimed at achieving high feasibility and concretization of their goals and means, providing strong link between tactical measures and ongoing projects, and balancing the interests of stakeholders. It is proved in the article that the urgent task of enhancing the state of clustering policy in Russia has become a framework to improve the quality of ITC’s projects initiated and creating an adequate system for monitoring the effectiveness of their implementation. While assessing the ITC projects it is proposed to take into account the investment effectiveness, associated with the home region development strategy, sectoral strategies, profile programs of companies’ innovative development on the public-private partnership basis, regional universities development programs, as well as the similar projects implemented in other regions of Russia.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To support the policy of innovation clustering based on PPP institutional and organizational issues of identification and formation of foci for innovative economic growth need to be addressed, and substantive stimulation is needed to develop effective production of goods at ITC for import substitution, restructuring and export development.",

Amid highly-charged political environments and deteriorating security situations, many advocacy organizations experienced intense or increasing pressure in 2016, especially if they were seen as challenging authoritarian governments with activities involving democratization, good governance, or human rights.\n\nA theme common to nearly every country report in this year’s index\nis the difficulty CSOs encounter in acquiring funds.A final trend worth noting is the growth in 2016 of coalitions, networks, and similar groupings.",

However, although private universities and university colleges are many in number, enrollment has continued to be higher in public universities. It was further noted that an increase in higher learning institutions and subsequent increase in access to higher education has not meant an improvement in the quality of education provided by the institutions. As such, PPPs have had no significant impact on the improvement of quality of education. This is mainly accounted for by the number and qualifications held by academic members of staff in private universities, the infrastructure as well as the programmes they offer.",

      "Key Findings": "Do foreign private investments (originated through public-private partnerships) improve the Water and Sanitation Sector in developing countries? I synthesize market sympathetic and skeptical arguments by noting that their relative salience depends on the level of corruption in a country. Specifically, I argue that private investments can effectively provide water and sanitation through public-private partnerships if they are adequately governed by the state. When corruption is high, however, private actors will pursue profit maximization over public needs, which leads them to provide water but not adequate sanitation. I test these arguments using a cross-sectional time series of fifty-six non-Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries from 1991 through 2012.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Together, the findings and conclusions of the 2009 study of the ProExAg and Exitos projects and the 2010 assessment highlighted several key lessons: \n1. When promoting NTAE crops, breaking into a new sector requires careful planning and taking a thorough, critical look at the opportunities and constraints and level of external support required to sustain success, typically a 10–15 year endeavor; \n2. Diversify the mix of non-traditional crops as winners cannot be predicted with certainty and slow-starters may take off later; \n3. Governments need to improve the transparency, availability and timing of export sector information to help sustain existing exports and promote new ones; and \n4. The opportunity for small-scale rural producers to participate in growing, harvesting, and packing NTAE crops creates labor-intensive job opportunities at higher wages.\n",

As market-based solutions to development challenges gain prominence, the Agency and its partners are sharing best practices, and contributing to a growing field of knowledge of public-private partnerships that advance market-based solutions to development challenges. Additionally, partnering is becoming embedded across USAID—we are investing in training to build the capacity of Agency staff around the world to work with the private sector, recruiting more people with private sector experience and skills, and implementing more robust approaches to manage ongoing relationships with private sector partners.`",

The global health community engages corporations – and CSR – through public-private partnerships. We have argued this value approach leaves out the importance of CSR policies as part of a “new governance” framework that shapes corporate policies and business’ evolving role in society. We have called this framework the CSR system, which is based on a definition of CSR as a set of “processes of mutual governance between business, civil society, national governments and international organizations” in the management of business’ role in society. This encompasses the more common definitions of CSR based on business motivation.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Put CSR standards for women’s health on the global health agendas a core issue\n2. Target key institutions tha`t can drive CSR policy change\n3. Leverage existing relationships and existing issues\n4. Generate data, evidence and tools related to workplace health policies and practices\n5.

      "Key Findings": "A plurality of the 35 projects, 16 (45.8%), received a mixed rating, meaning they had both positive and negative key findings. Nine projects (25.7%) were deemed unsatisfactory and seven (20%) satisfactory. Last, three projects (8.6%) could not be rated based on their evaluations alone. Looking at the project ratings by USAID technical office and sector provides some suggestions of trends. The Office of Agriculture’s projects were generally implemented well: three of four agriculture projects received satisfactory ratings.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Standardize evaluation SOWs by defining the concepts effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability. Ask evaluators straightforward questions addressing these issues.\n2. Key activity personnel should utilize monitoring data throughout the project so that if there are problems with capturing data or the M&E system more broadly, they are discovered early.\n3. USAID/Afghanistan should continue to prioritize timeliness of evaluations. In fiscal year 2014, only 33% of evaluations were done on time; in fiscal year 2015, 75% were timely. Where useful, independent midterm performance evaluations should be conducted to enable course-corrections to occur.\n4. USAID/Afghanistan should continue to prioritize population of the recommendation utilization template by CORs immediately following the completion of the evaluation report.\n5. OPPD should ensure that Program Development Officers use recommendations to inform new activity/project design by requiring evaluation utilization to be part of all new activity reviews, as well as portfolio reviews.",

      "Key Findings": "• Privately-led extension programs are multifaceted in nature. \n• Production-oriented goals tend to be prioritized (e.g. productivity, supply reliability) over social and environmental goals.\n• We find a variety of arrangements for funding and implementation, which include single-actor and multi-actor models. We also find more public-private collaboration in funding than in implementation.\n• The self-assessment scores suggest more progress toward achieving farm-level goals related to production and market access; and less progress toward achieving social (e.g. poverty alleviation) or environmental goals. \n• Extensions tactics and keys to success. Provision of financial services and farm management training appear to substantially advance several goals. ",

      "Key Findings": "The evaluation found that the ACI project activities are likely to have raised farmers’ cocoa productivity and thereby increased food security (see below). These productivity improvements have occurred through the adoption of good agricultural practices promoted by the project: improved planting materials, improved extension, spraying services, and finance. A number of factors constrained this progress. The capacity-building and enabling environment strengthening initiatives of Component I and parts of Components II and III are long-term activities that should not have been expected to contribute to increased income and food security during the project period. A greater use of evidence-based policy advocacy in Component I could have accelerated progress in achieving reforms that would have laid the groundwork for increased cocoa household incomes.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Project management should have a full-time market facilitation specialist who proactively pursues opportunities for commercially sustainable inputs and service delivery.\n\nTo help spur these reforms, project management should include a full-time policy advocacy specialist.\n\nManagement should take better advantage of synergies between components and other cocoa initiatives.",

      "Key Findings": "• Site visits and KIIs revealed that SEDA provided community members with concrete skills in project design and implementation, increased hope in a positive future for their village, and a sense that as a community they can work with government to address key community needs.\n\n• SEDA’s design of three complementary, integrated components synergistically contributing to the achievement of overall program objectives is a conceptually sound model.\n• SEDA’s approach to strengthening the capacities of CDCs has created participatory structures and procedures that appear sustainable.\n\n• While SEDA has worked diligently to integrate gender awareness into all of its activities, it has not consistently achieved gender equality in terms of actual participation in these activities.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. SEDA should continue to engage and provide support to the GoAJ within the purview of its SOW and strengthen linkages and complementarity of these activities with its local socio-economic\ndevelopment initiatives.\n2. Cluster projects may offer an opportunity for mobilized communities to cooperatively engage in addressing larger socio-economic priorities. As such, they should be further explored by SEDA.\n3. SEDA/USAID should consider the potential benefits and trade-offs of increasing the size of SEDA’s infrastructure grants.\n4. Resources permitting, the current Component 1 model of CDC development could be productively expanded to additional regions of Azerbaijan.\n5. Should in the present economic context, USAID/Azerbaijan decide to focus on distinct economic development objectives, traditional program models of entrepreneurship training and support, SME and value-chain development must be considered in conjunction with the MoEI.",

At the beginning of the project, the PCA was a classic GDA in terms of management and implementation. Both USAID and its private sector partners had established common goals and private sector partners were deeply involved in project implementation. One of the Armajaro managers had moved from Ecuador to Peru mainly to help oversee this new alliance.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Extend the PCA project for an additional three years.\n\n2. Examine the possibility of working jointly with the private sector during this three-year extension.\n\n3. Identify a neutral party entity that will have access to all the geo-referenced, fine flavored cocoa data.\n\n4. Establish a fee for service mechanism for the project.\n\n5. Assess which of the market-based approaches and solutions applied by the PCA may be replicated or adapted to benefit the results of other USAID projects or Government of Peru projects.",

      "Key Recommendations": "• Poultry Supply Chain Partnership – Provide beneficiary smallholder soy farmers with diversified year-round income, improved nutritional outcomes and direct market linkages to buyers along the poultry value chain.\n• Trader/Aggregator Partnerships – Expand USAID/Malawi’s flagship FtF activity, Integrating Nutrition in Value Chains (INVC), by strengthening the competitiveness of the soy and groundnut value chains while exploring high-value legumes, such as pigeon peas, lentils and guar.\n• Deforestation – Deforestation affects the private sector’s ability to operate in Malawi and the Team found several avenues through which to engage companies in the creation of mutually beneficial interventions (e.g. afforestation of high-value tree crops and NTFPs).\n• Co-management, community engagement and carbon financing – USAID/Malawi is currently discussing GDA concepts related to conservation finance; the Team presents insights and recommendations based on conversations with key stakeholders in these areas.",

      "Document Title": "Performance Evaluation of the Senegal Youthmap Jeunes Agriculteurs Project",
      "Key Findings": "• The JA Program exhibited a solid overall employment creation or job placement rates for program participants who completed the program, with 74% of respondents reporting some form of employment at the time of the survey. At the start of the program only 28 youth reported some form of employment (20 were self-employed and eight were salaried workers.\n• Self-reported average annual earnings for those participants who both responded to the survey and reported income either pre- or post-program increased by about $626 (150%). This is likely a result of youth moving from unemployment to employment, rather than increases in income associated with movement from one type of employment to another.\n• According to survey results, participants increased their social and personal empowerment with a robust improvement in conflict management and professional ethics and modest gains in personal skills as a result of the program. Improvements were lowest for the applied technical skills related to the agricultural sector value chain.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• The JA project can best be seen as a pilot experiment in enabling youth to create employment in the agricultural value chain. Its successor could prepare youth for employment creation with more training on financial management, and achieve a higher level of success by providing more guidance and follow-up on financing for the youth enterprises. \n• Any future JA project will need a dedicated project manager in the home office to manage relations with the implementing partners and at least two or three support staff to oversee the training and identify problems that need attention.\n• A future project of this nature should incorporate at its starting point an analysis of prospective labor market demand trends at the sub-sectoral level; in order to assess where employment growth opportunities are likely to be greatest by sub-industry and region; in order to better focus/orient training programs in a manner which will maximize prospective impact on employment and income growth.",

      "Key Findings": "President Thein Sein’s administration embarked on a series of generally positive political and economic reforms. Among the most visible signals of the reform agenda has been the raft of legislation passed by Myanmar’s parliament.  Interviews with micro and small businesses and those located outside the biggest cities suggest that economic governance has not changed as significantly for these businesses.  While Myanmar has begun to take steps to rebuild the capacity of government institutions, this process will be lengthy.  Economic data suggest, however, that the private sector is responsible for at least three-quarters of Myanmar’s economic activity.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Develop, publicize, and consistently implement processes of economic reform drafting, assessment, and implementation. \n\n2. Avoid over-emphasizing and building up expectations about quick economic wins.\n\n3. Increase transparency by making public additional information on taxes, government-granted business licenses, and other dimensions of business regulation.\n\n4. Reform various aspects of the S/R- and local-level business licensing system. \n\n5. Examine and consider reforming excise revenues.",

Exploring expert perspectives and the growing universe of multi- stakeholder initiatives, the report affirms that collaboration has become a central focus for global companies and other organizations pursuing transformative change.  At the same time, given the scope of the challenges and the inherent difficulties of collaboration, there is no guarantee that existing efforts will deliver the desired impact.

      "Key Findings": "All 32 LGSP partner towns successfully developed or updated their socioeconomic development strategies. LGSP developed and implemented a Municipal Property/Asset Management System to help partner towns manage their local revenues and improve local services. LGSP developed 30 Local Energy Efficiency Plans (LEEPs) and Local Energy Efficiency Action Plans (LEEAPs) and trained 94 local public authority staff on energy efficiency, improving municipal awareness of and capacity in issues surrounding energy efficiency.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "• More assistance is needed for operationalizing the integrated implementation of the national strategies, local development strategies, and urban plans. For example, towns must align their strategies with their financial resources and conduct continuous M&E on strategy implementation. \n• The CISC concept has proved its efficiency and several more towns have expressed their interest in implementing similar solutions at the town hall based on the success of the three pilot towns. There is a need for further decentralization to offer the town halls the ability to provide a larger range of services which currently are offered by different institutions, and the scope of the CISCs could be expanded as more services become the responsibility of LPAs. \n• Legislation on transparency in local public administration needs to be improved to improve enforcement of the requirement that publicize all information regarding council sessions and adopted decisions. \n• Improve the national policy and legal framework on public property management development, such as by establishing a new way to evaluate property value to strengthen property tax as a pillar of locally generated revenue.\n",

      "Key Findings": "Within the region, South Africa is the largest market for impact investing, with a particularly active set of domestic South African DFIs that fund South African enterprises. The majority of impact capital in the region has come from international DFIs and a range of non-DFI impact investors. Even excluding this strong domestic activity, South Africa is the center of Southern African impact investing.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Leverage technical assistance (TA) facilities to build the pre-investment pipeline: More pre-investment support for businesses is needed to develop a strong pipeline of investable opportunities. Increasingly, TA funders (e.g., USAID and DFID) recognize the importance of pre-investment support to get companies to the point where they can successfully raise capital.\n\n2. Develop sector specialization: Beyond bringing capital to portfolio companies, impact investors can drive growth, returns, and impact by focusing on the specific sectors in which their portfolio companies operate.\n\n3. Expand investment instruments: With the variety of early-stage businesses in Southern Africa, structured investments, such as milestone-based conversion and profit-sharing debt, can help to creatively fill a significant need for financing that straight equity and debt deals cannot.\n",

      "Key Findings": "Number of PPPs \nFor the period 2001 to 2014, USAID estimates it has engaged in some 1,600 PPPs, of which 1,481 appear in its data set. the average number of PPPs initiated per year is 105, but there has been a falloff in recent years, with an average of 145 PPPs per year during 2005- 2007 but only 90 per year for 2012-2014. \nValue \nThe investment in those 1,481 PPPs, shown by year in figure ii-2, totals $16.5 billion, for a yearly aver- age of $1.18 billion.4 about three-quarters of these, 73 percent, are less than $5 million each (figure ii-3). of the total, $4.710 billion, or 29 percent, is from the U.S. government (uSg)5 and $11.533 billion, or 70 percent, is from non-US government (non-USg) sources (figures ii-4 and ii-6).  \nPartners\nUSAID distinguishes between implementing partners, which are contracted to carry out a project, and resource partners, which contribute resources and share in the risk and governance of the PPP. resource partners in USAID’s data set include private businesses, financial institutions, NGOS, higher education institutions, pri- vate philanthropies, local and national government agencies, bilateral and multilateral institutions, and other organization types (see examples in table ii-2).\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Understanding the business sector: corporations would like USAID staff to better understand the role of the business sector in advancing development and as a partner to USAID.  Deepening strategic relationships: corporations want a more strategic relationship in which USAID treats them as real partners on more equal footing.  Fostering transparency: it is common for those outside a large bureaucracy like USAID to view it as a “black box” and to have difficulty knowing where and how to engage it.  Expanding convening: Corporate officials see USAID’s biggest strength as convening and creating alliances at the international, national, and subnational levels, with both public and private institutions.`",

The report provides a summary of the on-going projects by the United States Government (USG) and other donors in the country related to agriculture extension, and gender and nutrition impacts.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Institutional Capacity Building: Both the governmental agency DICTA and the NGO Oxfam expressed a need for information sharing among key agencies in understanding the needs and perceptions of indigenous communities, including effective ways of meeting community needs.\n\nCapacity Building for Women Farmers: Many governmental organizations have expressed a need for capacity building of women farmers on various topics related to gender, nutrition, and agriculture. MANCORSARIC has a need for regionally appropriate and simple materials on maternal and infant health as well as sexual education for young women at high risk of pregnancy.\n\nDissemination of Innovations for Women Farmers: The meeting with the for-profit institution Camosa Camiones prompted the team to look for manufacturers of small-scale equipment that is more appropriate for smallholders. An engineer for the Trilateral Cooperative demonstrated some smaller equipment he had designed with recycled materials for a lower cost.\n\nEngaging Men and Women: The Women’s Office in Cabanas expressed a need for research on gender-based violence (GBV), and if formal reporting mechanisms are appropriate to address the GBV problem. Based on these findings, there could be an opportunity to write up this model as a case study or facilitate an exchange between the gender specialist and other people in her same position in other municipalities to share lessons learned and best practices for reporting violent crimes.\n",

      "Key Findings": "Historically, the relationship between the private sector and international development has been deeply ambivalent. For many, a vibrant private sector and competitive markets are the essential prerequisites of development. For many others, development is principally concerned with ameliorating the dislocation associated with capitalist profit seeking. In the last generation, this ambivalence has given way to an emphasis on the complementarities between the private sector and development. Yet skeptics have continued to criticize the form of development this trend has promoted. We review the historical conditions behind this trend; the controversies concerning transnational corporations and foreign direct investment; the rise of corporate social responsibility; the parallel rise of philanthrocapitalism; and the growth of micro-credit as a market-oriented vehicle for poverty alleviation and empowerment. When taken together, it is clear that private sector actors have become increasingly influential in the new landscape of development, yet their effects remain ambiguous.",

      "Key Findings": "Largely due to chronic fiscal stress since the recent global economic crisis, there are calls for alternative ways of financing economic development. Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) have been identified as such alternatives. There is an increasing awareness that the private sector is not a competitor but a strategic partner in the drive for economic development. Using the case study of Botswana, which is experiencing revenue challenges as diamonds have not been selling well since 2008, this theoretical paper explores the possibility of using more PPPs to finance economic development. Grounded in interpretivist research methodology, using the survey research strategy and using secondary data sources in the form of a desk survey, it concluded that there is a case for the increased use PPPs to finance economic development. It further concluded that while there is demonstrated appetite for PPPs, to date, only a few projects have been procured through PPPs. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Hence, moving forward, and given the deteriorating revenue situation, there is a need to use more PPPs to deliver economic development. Finally, the paper argues that there is a need to reform the current PPP legal-institutional architecture and benchmark and peer-learn from best PPP practices in Africa such as South Africa and Nigeria and beyond.",

IPPF credits its participation in LMG with leading to an increased number of new family planning acceptors, from 481,000 to 725,000.\n\n• LMG supported and advised government-wide scale-up of leadership, management and governance curricula and programs in universities and ministries of health (MOH) in Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Côte d’Ivoire.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• USAID needs to plan a detailed country-by-country hand-over of leadership, management and governance work to governments or legacy institutions. This will require GH field support teams to work with missions and regional bureaus to identify assistance mechanisms, if needed beyond 2016.\n• During Year 5, LMG should accelerate work to strengthen institutions, including WAHO, AHLMN, and African Centre for Global Health and Social Transformation (ACHEST). MSH should accelerate strengthening IPPFAR and AMREF Health Africa as its consortium partners.\n• USAID should consider extending for up to a year programs that will not complete by September 2016 due to external factors (elections, terrorism, Ebola), as well as the ICRC DCHA LMG work.\n",

      "Key Findings": "• Based on progress against targets, Digital Green believes that its video-enabled approach is an appropriate and useful tool to enhance public-private extension services in Afghanistan.\n• Manual phone interviews were found to be an effective tool for conducting adoption verifications, wherein, using a sample size of 43 randomly selected farmers out of 244 eligible farmers, physical observations confirmed farmers’ self-reported responses and the adoption data that extension agents and lead farmers reported in COCO 97.6% of the time. \n• IVRS, while promising for its ability to reduce possible bias and subjectivity, will require more testing and likely greater sensitization among farmers to prompt their engagement with the system. \n• The percentage of women who engaged in video production and dissemination activities was higher than anticipated. Digital Green believes that engaging female extension workers and motivating them to engage more women were keys to this achievement. This emphasis on female extension workers has proven to be useful to programs like the AAEP-WIA.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "NHLP is particularly keen to leverage Digital Green’s approach to extend their horticulture extension program. They have expressed a need for technical assistance and monitoring support to plan and execute video’s inclusion. Digital Green and NHLP are both concerned that a gap between the pilot project’s completion and the launch of new activities may result in the loss of momentum among trained partners, extension agents, lead farmers, communities engaged under the pilot.  In light of low levels of literacy and high levels of insecurity in Afghanistan, Digital Green and the Director General of Agriculture believe that technological solutions, such as IVRS, warrant further investigation, testing, and application in Afghanistan.",

      "Key Findings": "• The evaluation team determined that the LEAD project was successful in stimulating investment, primarily measured by funds matched by LEAD grantees.\n\n• Although LEAD activities for capturing Diaspora remittances conform to best practices documented in the literature reviewed by the evaluators, by the end of 2015 LEAD had limited success in testing and effectively implementing new methods for capturing Diaspora remittances for development.\n\n• Diaspora SME and local grantees confirmed that access to financing is a major roadblock for them, and they credit LEAD for removing that constraint through the matching funds.\n\n• LEAD succeeded in stimulating SMEs to improve their business practices, despite a few inconsistencies cited by BPC applicants regarding clear guidance on trainings and processes.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. We recommend that USAID insure continuity and sustainability of the LEAD project even beyond 2017, the year the project is scheduled to end.\n\n2. We recommend a small grant management unit with six to ten grantees assigned to each manager and oversight from a senior\nlevel position.\n\n3. PADF should develop clear communications protocols for each part of the process to increase transparency across the board.\n\n4. Implement steps to recruit more SEs and CBOs by using innovative communication channels.\n\n5. Implement steps to extend capacity building (business plans, project writing seminars) to CBOs as a means of securing better quality applications to the community project component.",

Under the “Improving Resilience of Vulnerable Populations” theme, for example, building social capital was among the most common intervention objectives linked with risk-reduction strategies. Programs that focused on recovery from shocks relied heavily on community participation and trust. Likewise, under “Expanded Markets, Value Chains and Increased Investment,” community-based organizations (CBOs) were key to lifting vulnerable groups out of poverty.",

Private investment in capital projects will be vital for Russia to meet these goals. To facilitate private investment, the Russian government has embarked on a series of reforms aimed at improving the investment climate and creating a robust institutional framework for private sector participation in concessions and Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). The OECD’s 2012 Council Recommendation on Principles for Public Governance of Public-Private Partnerships (the PPP Recommendation) aims to support governments facing trade-offs between three demands inherent in a PPP project process. This article provides an overview of the alignment of the policies of the Russian Federation in the area of public governance of PPPs with these recommendations.",

      "Document Title": "Role of public private partnership in West Java, Indonesia",
      "Key Findings": "The purpose of this paper is to analyze and develop policy recommendations implementation sources of development funding that come from the PPP in West Java in an effort to improve the optimization of the utilization of these funds. The method used was qualitative research with emphasis on four main aspects, namely: institutional analysis and the stakeholders involved, regulation and policy analysis, implementation and analysis of the shape and pattern analysis of sources of funding. This research shows that in terms of funding, the banking institutions are still major stakeholders in the financing of PPP implementation in West Java, Indonesia that has experienced improvement in the regulation of the sector by the government. However, there are still obstacles in the implementation of PPP and limited\nalternative sources of financing of PPP in in West Java Indonesia. To optimize the sources of development in funding primarily coming from the PPP scheme in achieving development goals in West Java Indonesia can be done by collaborated of stakeholder.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "• For Institutional Aspects, to strengthen institutional PPP, the role of local governments must be expanded in the implementation of the PPP the concept and establishment must been hanced in an effort to facilitate and monitor PPP projects.\n• For Aspects of Policy and Regulation, there is the need to clarify the authority of the central government in the implementation of PPP, to develop policies to strengthen the PPP activity planning, as well as the preparation of the national medium term development plan that states clearly the role of government and the private sector in development funding.\n• For Implementation Aspects, the preparation of PPP can be strengthened through improvement of PPP executive capacity and widen the development of PPP implementation; it also needs to strengthen the role of government in the implementation of PPP by clearly defining the government to guarantee the planning of an activity that is in harmony with the PPP timeframe development planning.\n• Aspects of Funding Sources and Patterns mean government policies are needed to bridge the short term or medium and long term funding needed to optimize the mobilization of the source of banking funds. The government should issue a policy that can provide convenience in using resources from the non-banking sector. To optimize the sources of development in funding primarily coming from the PPP scheme in achieving development goals in West Java Indonesia\ncan be done by collaborated of stakeholder.\n",

      "Key Findings": "• Evaluations are doing a better job compared to prior years of addressing gender differentials and providing sex-disaggregated data for evaluation findings, where appropriate. \n• The number of E3 evaluations addressing gender differentials in project access, participation, or benefits rose from a low of 15 percent in 2011 to 67 percent in 2014. \n• The number of E3 evaluations providing sex-disaggregated data on evaluation findings at all levels increased from 7 percent in 2010 to 53 percent in 2014. \n• Evaluation reports highlighted the importance of the availability of sex-disaggregated project data in contextualizing and understanding project results. \n• Evaluation reports noted the need to consider the implications of gender norms during project design. Evaluations from across all sectors recognized the workload of women in the household as an impediment to gaining access to education, resources, knowledge, and community participation.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "In order to improve gender integration, the study recommends that:\nUSAID Program Offices ensure that Mission Orders and other operating unit procedures are consistent with USAID’s guidance on integrating gender into all program cycle activities, including evaluation, and specifically with How-to Note: Engendering Evaluation at USAID. USAID Evaluation Points of Contact and others involved drafting evaluation Statements of Work (SOWs) explicitly include in the SOW:\n• Detailed expectations for data disaggregation by sex for each evaluation question, as well as information to be obtained on specific gender concerns;\n• A requirement that evaluators go beyond simply referencing sex-disaggregated data to document whether activities are actually reducing gender gaps, consistent with USAID guidance on engendering evaluations; and\n• Clear expectations for the evaluation team to include members with experience in gender programming, performance monitoring, evaluation and/or research, when there are gender concerns.\n",

      "Key Findings": "In place of a government-driven focus on crop production targets, the paper offers a concrete and systematic strategy for how Myanmar can modernize its agricultural and food sector. The strategy embraces market-oriented, private sector-led investment, innovation, and dynamism that is centered on small farmers throughout the country. It requires forward-looking and efficient government policies and institutional support with greater interaction among key stakeholders characterized by full transparency and accountability.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Provide farmers with the freedom to choose which agricultural products to grow that will provide the best opportunity for them to increase their incomes relative to their land and labor assets, a policy to be embedded in appropriate ministerial statements, laws, and regulations.\n\n2. Provide farmers with greater land tenure security over agricultural lands.\n\n3. Invest in supply chain infrastructure – transport and logistics, wholesale markets, electricity, and Internet, as well as research, extension, skill-building, and security – along all spatial segments of the agricultural and food sector.",

      "Key Findings": "There is substantial momentum for water supply and sanitation development in Indonesia, with the national government setting new sector targets to achieve Universal Access in drinking water and sanitation by the end of 2019, making available significant budgets and taking measures to strengthen the financial position of district water enterprises. In achieving these targets, the national government is working closely with district governments and water enterprises, which are the key institutions, responsible for WASH at the local level. IUWASH has established excellent relations with the local governments (LG) and PDAMs it has been working with. Over a period of 5 years, it has provided a wide range of advisory and supporting services and at the LG level, it has helped to create considerable momentum, as demonstrated by the doubling of LG water and sanitation budgets during the same period. IUWASH advisers have often taken the role of a catalyst, bringing stakeholders together in resolving common problems and stimulating and supporting action. In doing so, IUWASH has adopted a hands-on and flexible approach, which is very much appreciated by both LG institutions and communities.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The quality and use of IUWASH CKM products can be further improved by Applying standard peer reviews by GOI and relevant sector experts from other projects and development partners.  \nGender Mainstreaming: Decide at an early stage (in design or start-up) the extent to which gender should be mainstreamed under IUWASH Plus and ensure that this is backed up by the resources (staffing and budgets) necessary to succeed in such programming.  The following recommendations are intended either for IUWASH or, given that it will very soon come to a close, consideration by the follow-on project or other WASH activity that may carry on its activities. \nSuch recommendations include: a. Support the national and local governments to review and strengthen the application of STBM in urban and peri-urban areas, , including correction of any deficiencies in the theoretical underpinnings, differentiation for various target groups, and identifying indicators for behavioral change. Social marketing and participatory investment planning may provide a useful platform for such a revised strategy and the strategy should more expressly address both water supply and sanitation related programming.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The level of uncertainty for development support is high in the near term, due to the major shift in global goals and strategies, the refugee crisis in Europe, other humanitarian crises including fragile states, and impending changes in leadership of institutions key for child health.  The implications of the shift to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for health and/or children are still emerging, but priorities, political commitment, and likely funding will be more broadly distributed and possibly with less clarity of purpose. If any of these resources are “zero-sum,” child health (other than immunization) is likely to be working with less.  The World Bank has heightened its presence in reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health (RMNCAH) with the Global Financing Facility (GFF). There is political reliance on the GFF to finance and rationalize financing of child health, especially those components not financed through GAVI or the Global Fund. However, there is a high level of uncertainty about its potential effectiveness.  The high-level core architecture for child health (and RMNCAH more broadly) is emerging. It will be very important to track the place and priority of child health within this architecture.",
      "Key Recommendations": "With the shift to the SDGs, child health should be deliberately reframed so that it emphasizes the value of children, a more holistic approach including “newborns and infants and children” as one, and a clear aim for equity.\n\nThe principal global partners in child health need to come to agreement on and then designate and support a lead organization to consistently provide overall messaging for child health.\n\nKey stakeholders need to create and implement a shared strategic approach for:\na) Raising the visibility of child health as a whole rather than in subcomponents\nb) Ensuring a strong child health voice in Strategy 2.0, SDG3 monitoring, and the GFF\nc) Bridging child health components of existing strategies across institutions in such a way that country action is more likely\n",

      "Document Title": "Situational Analysis of the Private Sector in the Delivery of Family Planning Services in Egypt: Current Status and Potential for Increased Involvement",
      "Key Findings": "There has been a steady decline in private sector contribution to FP service delivery since 1995, when 64.3% of FP users obtained their methods from the private sector.\n\nKey challenges that hinder the private sector’s contribution to FP service delivery are: (1) lengthy and complicated registration procedures, along with a rigid pricing system, which limit the range of family planning methods available on the market; (2) FP method stock-outs often due to lengthy importation procedures; (3) low demand for contraceptives.\n\nDespite the above challenges, this study identifies several opportunities for an increased role for the private sector in family planning service delivery.\n\nOwing to their on-going relationships and established rapport with their customers, private physicians and pharmacists are well positioned to address reasons for unmet need for family planning, such as infrequent sex, fear of method side-effects, and husband’s disapproval.\n\nAt the policy level, amendments made by the Egyptian government to existing investment laws could make the Egyptian market more attractive to pharmaceutical companies.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Adopt a total market approach whereby MOHP facilities target those who live in remote rural and low income urban areas; NGOs target lower middle-class women; private doctors target middle- and upper-class women; and pharmacists target all groups of women and possibly husbands.\n2. Create demand for private FP services through social marketing campaigns that specifically target young couples, those in the upper two wealth quintiles, and those who live in urban areas. \n3. Capitalize on all opportunities to counsel women and their husbands about FP including during antenatal care, postnatal care, and children’s health care visits.\n4. Educate physicians and pharmacists about new family planning methods through brochures, newsletters, conferences, and medical representatives.\n5. The private sector should make services more attractive to clients through enforcing service delivery standards, upgrading their FP knowledge and skills and offering extended hours and\nadditional services.",

      "Key Findings": "The evaluation team had insufficient quantitative evidence to determine the impact of this work on the Ministry’s capacity to plan, budget, deliver, and measure ABE for youth.\n\nThe most effective strategies for recruiting out of school youth to attend ABE classes included community publicity campaigns; and pro-active ABE committees, facilitators, administrators and learners\ninteracting with youth encouraging them to enroll.\n\nThe AYP model of providing livelihood trainings is effective and is the most in-demand area of their service provision.\n\nThe literacy and numeracy curriculum provided by AYP seem to be effective learning tools to address learners’ needs, pending final OLA/EGMA results.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Through the end of the current project lifecycle, AYP should continue to engage the CEOs and DEOs in the community-based transition plan meetings. AYP should also work to share and integrate monitoring tools to strengthen the capacity of interested individuals among the county and district staff; there are some extremely bright and motivated individuals in these positions who would welcome an opportunity to expand their capacity in this area.  In the remaining time of AYP, the project needs to implement its community transition plan and aid the ABE committees in helping to think through how they will keep their structure, continue to exist and carry out their responsibilities. This way, the committees can sustain the retention of learners.  For the remaining period of AYP’s implementation, the activity should continue to support the activities of PTIs and youth clubs to provide skills training for learners. This should include the extension of short-term skills training from PTIs to additional members of the community as needed and desired by the communities.",

      "Document Title": "Enablers and Obstacles to Aid Delivery: Yemen Crisis 2015",
      "Key Findings": "Failure to provide adequate humanitarian assistance in the Yemeni crisis of the mid-2010s stemmed from poor humanitarian leadership (there was much \"double-hatting\" and sometimes even \"triple-hatting\" among key staff members, hindering agencies' abilities to succeed), agencies' choice to evacuate Yemen in the thick of the crisis (INGO and UN managers were swept into a constant round of meetings, so coordination became the project), political issues (the UN accepted funding from Saudi Arabia), security management issues (INGOs often did not trust UN security, but their staying in Yemen was contingent upon their safety), and resources, as donors were critical of the lack of information on the ground and many INGOs had trouble with staffing. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Certain items proved enablers in the Yemeni crisis. The following enablers should be strengthened: \n\n1. Deconfliction did help build trust and protect assets to some extent, but it should be made less time-consuming and cumbersome. \n2. Agencies which needed to move large amounts of materials overland stated that the availability of private transporters was an enabler, but private transporters and/or other members of the private sector should also be recruited to provide monitoring and accountability. \n3. The heavy use of local suppliers was a method to work-around the blockade and difficulties in importation; actors should explore making drugs and other medical supplies available on the market. \n4. Humanitarian agencies should engage in networking and context analysis. \n5. Organisations with a longer-term presence theoretically were in a better position to negotiate access and manage the various administrative obstacles; empirical evidence should be collected on whether or not this truly was the case. \n6. Expats should be utilized, as expats provide objectivity and a higher level of resistance to external pressures, as well as emergency programming experience. \n\nThe article states that most important would be to increase networking and context analysis capabilities, have the mindset and capacity to establish operations in the field; and follow up with promises made.

      "Key Findings": "As the United Nations seeks to be a catalyst, the private sector is working to become an indispensable partner in disaster risk reduction, emergency preparedness, response and recovery. Though the public-private partnership approach is not yet systematic, the trend indicates that more and more businesses will engage on this basis, combining capabilities to make a difference. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "More effective engagement between the private sector and aid agencies could be furthered by implementing the following recommendations: Develop strategic communications materials to capture the wide variety of private sector collaboration with aid agencies; ensure aid agency country offices and businesses' branches are able to draw upon and 'activate' existing global partnerships; where feasible, establish a private sector focal point in countries that are disaster-prone and which have a record of private sector engagement in humanitarian issues.

Nearly a third of Tanzanians live in poverty and the rate of stunting in children under five is 35%. With the majority of Tanzanians employed in agriculture, growth in this sector is a promising route for poverty reduction. In order to achieve the ambitious goals of growth in the agricultural sector, it is necessary to empower women. While discrimination against women is technically illegal, customary laws and practices that discriminate against women are still common.",

      "Key Findings": "Through the District Management Committees, SDS has greatly enhanced coordination of various key implementers in the local governments (LGs).\n\nThe robust SDS grants management and other financial accountability indicators were used to strictly assess district performance every quarter, with results determining eligibility levels for subsequent disbursements.\n\nThe SDS program was a complementary mechanism for strengthening LG systems by providing financial as well as technical support to complement resources from the DBTA programs.\n\nThe original SDS program design was robust enough to accommodate all the modifications.\n\nUnder the SDS program, districts received both grants and TA aimed at strengthening decentralized systems and processes so as to enhance the LG’s ownership, autonomy, and independence.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. In order to consolidate the gains made in strengthening LG systems, USAID should continue providing technical and financial support to the districts.\n\n2. The PBF principle should be maintained and embedded across all granting mechanisms. Districts that demonstrate compliance to the set PBF criteria should be given more discretionary funds to address locally identified priorities.\n\n3. Modifications to future similar programs should, to the extent possible, involve the implementing partners right from the outset to ensure ownership and improve chances of sustainability.\n\n4. In the future, in situations involving more than one TA arm, there is a need to synchronize policies and priorities so as to realize the intended synergies.\n\n5. All national level players deemed critical for achieving program results should be fully integrated in the program design with clear roles, responsibilities, and expected outputs.",

Dozens of countries came to the aid of Nepal, some of them, such as India and Pakistan, within a few short hours. Nonetheless, an unnecessary amount of people were killed, injured or otherwise had their lives permanently altered. This report details many of the challenges experienced by international and Nepalese actors before, during and after the disaster. Here, the main findings are briefly summarized.\nOverall, three major themes are persistent throughout: 1. Insufficient preparation for a natural disaster of this magnitude, 2. lack of information and dissemination thereof, 3. Lack of effective coordination at all levels of resilience and response.",

The analysis also provides an overview of the structure and functions of each value chain, identifies priority end markets and constraints to realizing their benefits, and recommends potential value chain upgrading strategies. The results provide a foundation on which more detailed intervention strategies can be developed.",

This paper has identified some of the key activities that should be addressed by Myanmar. While the list of proposed actions is extensive, they are spread across a range of government ministries and other bodies for implementation. What is missing is a central mechanism to monitor implementation of Myanmar’s ASEAN obligations on a regular basis. This function will in part be performed by the monitoring and evaluation units at the ASEAN Secretariat",

      "Key Findings": "Stakeholders’ understanding of IFFIm’s financing mechanism and its outcomes varied and many stakeholders wanted more information. Participants highlighted that the change in the macro-economic environment following the 2008 financial crisis affected national policy in donor countries and subsequently the number of new commitments IFFIm received. Since Gavi is now seen as a successful and mature organization, participants stated that donors prefer to donate directly to Gavi. The pharmaceutical industry valued IFFIm for providing funding stability and flexibility. Other stakeholders valued IFFIm’s ability to access funds early and enable Gavi to increase vaccine coverage. Overall, stakeholders thought IFFIm was successful, but they had divergent views about IFFIm’s on-going role. Participants listed two issues where bond financing mechanisms may be suitable: emergency preparedness and outcome-based time-limited interventions.",
      "Key Recommendations": "IFFIm-like mechanisms have been proposed to fund a wide range of other global health issues, including malaria control, Ebola vaccine and noncommunicable diseases.\n•\tFirst, bond financing could have a role in emergency preparedness, including disasters and pandemics.\n•\tSecond, bond financing could support quantifiable, outcomes-based, time-limited interventions, including the formation of a new organization or delivery of a specific intervention, for example a catch-up vaccination program.",

      "Key Recommendations": "It is recommended that USAID allocate resources to finance a market survey.\n\nFuture program designed by USAID and its partners should take into account the incentives of all actors (Mobile Money Operators (MNOs), consumers, agents, merchants, financial institutions) in\norder to foster the development of an effective ecosystem.\n\nFuture programming in the microfinance sector must continue to include support for the adoption of ICT and the acquisition of operating assets that strengthen the capacity of FIs.\n\nFuture USAID programming should consider offering more flexible loan terms (particularly the principal amount) that take into account a beneficiary’s ability to repay.\n\nAgricultural insurance is vital for the development of the sector and it is important to provide support for related schemes; for instance, facilitating agricultural risk sharing among MFIs or extending Development Credit Authority (DCA).",

      "Key Recommendations": "In order to build on the achievements of the previous Trade Hub and effectively design and implement new and follow-on activities across all the results areas, the future implementing partner should: \n1. Undertake a stakeholder and results mapping exercise to ensure that the future iteration of the Trade Hub makes informed decisions about new and follow-on activities, as well as builds on the results, knowledge, and relationships generated by the previous project. \n2. As part of the review process described above, be sure to assess former Trade Hub activities that were considered complete, in order to ascertain whether the intended results and objectives have been sustained by the stakeholders.\n3. Implement a formalized process to assess requests for support from USAID and host country counterparts.\n",

      "Key Findings": "1. Relevance: Grant activities were highly relevant to stakeholder and beneficiary interests, mostly due to grantees’ consulting with local communities and relying on their local knowledge when selecting grant activities.\n\n2. Effectiveness: Grants effectively facilitated engagement between citizens and the government.\n\n3. Sustainability: CVP encouraged sustainability from the start of the grant process by requiring grantees to submit sustainability plans.\n\n4. Grants Under Contract: The two delivery mechanisms that supported CVP’s successful programming were 1) the GUC contractual grant framework between USAID and implementing partner Trust for Democratic Education and Accountability (TDEA) and 2) the Fixed Amount Award (FAA) grant funds disbursal system to grantees.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. The implementing partner should initiate formal linkages with the government at the beginning of the implementation process.\n\n2. The implementing partner of future similar projects should emphasize including high-impact activities, such as information campaigns and community-level meetings, in the request for\napplications (RFA) process and throughout the activity planning stage.\n\n3. The implementing partner should increase the number of grantee capacity-building trainings relative to CVP and conduct the trainings early in the grant startup phase to build the capabilities of grantee organizations before grants begin.\n\n4. The implementing partner should create an effective payment system to improve the grantee experience relative to that under CVP by increasing payments for initial milestone deliverables, reducing the total number of milestone deliverables, and creating an escrow account so the project can access additional program funds when necessary to continue project activities. 5. The implementing partner should develop a communications manual alongside a Grant Management Information System (GMIS) training presentation to improve communication between the project and grantees and deploy both during an off-site retreat with grantees.\n",

The need for more resources is evident and an increased focus on education systems in these difficult and complex contexts—the challenges are immense and the funding gap is huge.\n2. Education interventions in conflict and crisis affected environments need to be subject to interrogation on the basis not of their effects and outcomes on the educational system alone but also on the particular conflict and crisis context within which they are inserted. \nWe need to ask whether specific interventions are having a positive/negative impact on, for example, post-conflict national recovery, or assisting the needs of a country recovering from a crisis event (e.g. the Ebola crisis in Liberia, or an earthquake or other natural disaster).

      "Key Findings": "1. The Team found no evidence of a cold chain in Bangladesh, but did find evidence of a frozen food chain not linked to any of the project’s subsectors (fresh vegetables, poultry, or dairy).\n\n2. The Evaluation Team did not find evidence of economic viability in marketing vegetables through a cold chain system after three years of operating the pilot project.\n\n3. Attempts to leverage private sector investment were unsuccessful.\n\n4. The sustainability of the CCBA intervention faced two major constraints.\n\n5. CCBA incorporated gender in its project interventions on a limited scale.\n\n6. The project included a study document (CCBA 2014f, without authorship, dated April 2014) that was somewhat comprehensive, but it did not assess the demand for fresh vegetables by upscale\nretailers and consumers.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. High-value vegetable producers in the initial Collection Centers established by CCBA as of the end of Year 2 of the project should continue to be assisted by the FtF Bangladesh AVC Program, particularly related to the second component of the CCBA project.\n\n2. Despite the lack of progress in cold chain development in the CCBA project, there must be a continued effort by international donors to encourage cold chain implementation in Bangladesh.\n\n3. USAID should continue to invest in PPPs related to cold chain development for high-value crops in Bangladesh.\n\n4. Critical for the project: the ability to extend the shelf life of HVVs at Collection Centers should be part of a strategy to cope with such external factors.\n\n5.

      "Key Findings": "• Considered in the context of political, social and economic instability during 2014-2015 and the challenges posed by the current security situation, Mashrou3i has made notable progress in generating sustainable employment for youth in the four interior governorates in which it has been implemented, slightly surpassing its target for direct jobs creation and thereby demonstrating the efficacy of its intervention approach.\n\n• The GDA approach, including the Italian Development Cooperation and USAID, and the engagement of an experienced Public International Organization (PIO) as the major implementing partner, leveraged financial resources, human capital, and institutional experience in support of program results; enlisted the extraordinary technical expertise of a major private sector corporation; and demonstrated the value and potential of such a unique multi-donor public-private partnership (PPP) model. \n\n• UNIDO’s cooperation with SBSs has contributed both directly and indirectly to employment creation.\n\n• The evaluation team was able to independently validate a sample of Mashrou3i employment information, and found no evidence of error or misrepresentation of results.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Continue support for job creation in Tunisia’s Interior Regions\n2. Continue to work with HP-LIFE\n3. Work through private business support service providers to provide enterprise development, entrepreneurship, and employment services\n4. Support entrepreneurship development programs that provide coaching by experienced business experts\n5. Reorient Regional Business Centers and API Regional Offices",

      "Document Title": "Building local institutional capacity to implement agricultural carbon projects: participatory action research with Vi Agroforestry in Kenya and ECOTRUST in Uganda",
      "Key Findings": "Results are presented as case studies which include project context, roles of local project actors, actions selected, and the outcomes of the actions on the key actors targeted. The actions focused on building the capacities of community-based intermediaries, facilitating partnerships with local government and local non-governmental organizations, and supporting a more active role played by women. Key findings from this process were that community-based intermediaries can play a leading role in land management trainings; local government involvement is\ncritical to project success; local non-governmental organizations and businesses can play central roles in training and providing market incentives to farmers to implement sustainable practices; and women’s roles in projects can grow if project benefits are aligned with their needs and trainings are made more accessible.",
      "Key Recommendations": "These cases demonstrate that there is substantial scope for the responsibilities within agricultural carbon projects, and by extension climate-smart agriculture initiatives more broadly, to be institutionalized at the local level. However, regardless of the institutional setup, due to carbon market factors beyond the control of these projects, the financial case for smallholder projects that rely solely on financing from carbon credits remains challenging to these projects and others like them. As programmatic and policy-led approaches grow from these project models, it may be easier to find ways to integrate carbon financing with support for climate change adaptation, rural development, and ecosystem services provision. With these new models, the ability to institutionalize management and implementation capacity at the local level will remain critically important.",

      "Key Findings": "The compound sanitation strategy is still in the early stages of trial and adaptation in both Kumasi and Ga West. In each location the strategy represents the most challenging and long-term component of a wider program to improve sanitation, including improvements to public toilets as an interim measure while the strategy gains traction. Complex tenancy arrangements, limited investment in low-income housing and high population growth only add to the challenges. By seeking to engage all stakeholders involved in this issue, a comprehensive strategy has been created; one which explicitly targets bottom-of-the-pyramid consumers and those most often marginalized in the decision-making process for getting a toilet. Having committed to improved budgetary support to sanitation service delivery, it is envisaged that KMA and GWMA will be positioned in time to implement the strategy with minimal external stakeholder involvement. The ultimate goal is to develop a refined model that could be replicated in other Ghanaian cities and adopted nationally by the Environmental Health and Sanitation Directorate at the ministry level.",

      "Key Findings": "The study provides insight into the importance of the YALI program, but questions whether it can make a positive impact and be effectively implemented in Africa. The findings suggest that there is lack of clarity in the objectives of the program, particularly with regards to the role of the key stakeholders including academics, government institutions, policymakers and the private sector. The results underscore the need for sound and clear-cut government policies toward entrepreneurship development that will foster a better relationship between the African governments and the United States Agency for International Development program.",
      "Key Recommendations": "•Encourage entrepreneurship training and education for youth and women: Government policy that targets entrepreneurship training and education for youth and women should be encouraged in Africa. Specifically, developing a specialized program on informal entrepreneurship that is integrated into the curriculum and funding a program for African entrepreneurship trainers should be the focus of the policy.\n•Integrate a participatory approach into multi-stakeholder partnership: The majority of the respondents emphasized that a participatory approach through multi-stakeholder partnership for entrepreneurship development should be encouraged.\n•Adopt the triple helix concept to strengthen stakeholder partnership: Building on the issue of stakeholder partnership, the triple helix concept can play an important role in the implementation of the YALI program.\n•Learn from emerging economies: Government partnership with the transition or emerging economies for entrepreneurship development should be given more priority in Africa, as advocated by some respondents.",

Governance includes regional and national policy, national legal and regulatory frameworks, local governance, and the influence of the different types of capital described in the\nRFSA.\n\nMarine ecosystem health and fisheries resources: Though neither country has a national fisheries management plan, or a transboundary management plan, operationalizing and strengthening fisher organizations to inform management can inform and support future management planning by the respective governments.\n\nSustainable fisheries-based livelihoods: Small-scale fishers lack training, equipment, and basic access to credit, which limits their livelihoods, business growth, and implementation of sustainable fishing practices.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Governance: Transboundary resources management requires both SVG and Grenada to work together to ensure sustainability. This will entail establishing a joint national fisheries committee of informed fisher organizations to outline a way forward, with strengthened capacity to implement actions.\n\nMarine ecosystem health and fisheries resources: data are needed on current fish landing, exports, and fish stock sustainable yield to inform decision-making. Data collection systems that meet Fisheries Division standards should be established for the Grenadines.\n\nSustainable fisheries-based livelihoods: Project training, equipment, labeling, and marketing will further increase post harvest quality standards and available niche markets.",

      "Document Title": "USAID/Philippines Health Portfolio Evaluation",
      "Key Findings": "DOH systems strengthening in data, supply chain and training: Given the enhanced policy and budgetary environment the DOH enjoys the gaps evident in the public sector supply chain, data management and utilization system, and the DOH’s ability to reach LGUs with technical systems and leadership training, this would be an opportune time to reposition USAID’s portfolio from being an extension of DOH services and training to one that partners with the DOH to strengthen government systems and develop the systems needed to contract out for technical services. \n\nPhilHealth: PhilHealth is an integral part of moving toward universal health care (UHC) in the Philippines. USAID has enabled facilities and individuals to enter the PhilHealth system, and despite policies aimed at meeting the needs of the poor and an exemplary showing, PhilHealth experience in moving social insurance to clients in a decentralized health system demonstrates a need for better clarity and evidence-based expansion of the packages.  Policy development: The University of the Philippines Economic Foundation (UPecon) and others have helped developed laws and guidance and conducted studies on a wide range of topics, the Zuellig Family Foundation (ZFF) program has raised awareness and skills among LGU leaders to address health issues and track progress, and both the ID and MNCHN/FP projects have contributed to policy development.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "DOH systems strengthening in data, supply chain and training: Work on these initiatives will require development of or improvements in DOH procurement mechanisms to engage third party technical assistance and training.\n\nPhilHealth: USAID is well positioned to explore a direct working partnerships with PhilHealth at both the national and regional levels, focused on increasing access to quality MNCHN/FP and ID packages, and better linking of PhilHealth and providers at regional and local levels.\n\nPolicy development: Recommended policy activities for the future include: capacitating the DOH’s Health Policy Development and Planning Bureau; improving the flow of information about government policies (especially those of PhilHealth); tapping CSOs, the media and other institutions to improve accountability of government or as a watchdog for the private sector; and a plan for policy analysis for specific audiences that addresses timely issues, based on USAID’s experience at the national and regional levels, such as health services and rights of minors, women’s health as a human right, and role of medicines in UHC.\n",

On the regulatory/legislative front MMAP was a key informant for the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) but had no impact on the intractable Parliamentary process. \n\n• In addition, USAID’s Malawi FtF Strategy (May 2011) was not informed by the USAID Financial Sector Knowledge Sharing Mobile Money National Action Plan (November 2011), which explains the absence of MM in the FtF Strategy.\n\n• During the lifespan of MMAP up to March 31, 2016 there has been significant growth of MM in Malawi. Transaction volume doubled over the same base number of agents.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• There is need for direct technical assistance to institutionalize sustainable change as compared to how MMAP defined technical assistance\n• Successful MM implementation must begin internally with management and staff who understand the business case for their organization and adopt m-wallets themselves before they try to convince farmers and other beneficiaries to use the same product/service",

This study did not analytically investigate the relative return on investment of public-good investments vs. direct investments, nor did it measure the causal impact of the Lab’s investments on development outcomes. That said, the anecdotal evidence that we gathered suggested that USAID's leadership and ability to \"crowd in\" further financial and human resources gives it a particular comparative advantage compared to other development actors.",

Conversely, business action or inaction can have a negative impact on children, putting their interests at risk. Being mindful of the possible impacts of business can help ensure that actions and operations above all do no harm, as well as help mitigate and reduce human rights risks.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Some examples of actions that businesses can take for risk reduction and response:\n- Based on risk assessments, businesses can ensure that\nbusiness operations are not aggravating existing hazards (e.g. contributing to desertification or erosion) and decide to avoid risk by limiting their exposure to hazards or not investing in disaster-prone areas.\n- Collaborate with other businesses, for instance through Global Compact Local Networks or other business networks/associations, to identify good practices in disaster risk reduction.\n-Leverage the company’s communication assets and influence vis-à-vis the government and other stakeholders to raise awareness on children’s rights and child rights issues. Discuss how children’s rights can be assessed and hazards on children mitigated.\n-Where possible and with the support of experts to\nensure safety and meaningful engagement, consult with children – both girls and boys – as part of the assessment, in close collaboration with experts.\n-Invest in training, mentoring and capacity building activities and development of technologies that improve the ability of the education system to cope and respond to education needs.\n-With government and/or humanitarian organizations, and based on pre-agreed arrangements, offer physical assets – transport, logistics, distribution and warehousing – that will allow responders to deliver assistance to the most vulnerable populations.\n-Consult with other businesses to see how, through mutual support and sharing of assets, businesses can support humanitarian and development partners with urgent actions,\nsuch as coordinating delivery of school, nutrition, hygiene,\nshelter and/or other supplies through provision of free or\nlow-cost supplies’ transportation.",

The applied PEA research identified three themes as indirect drivers of biodiversity loss that should be familiar by now:\n\n• Patronage networks, which play an important role in the illegal or unregulated acquisition of resources (e.g., fish, land, forest resources and minerals) and abuse of power leaves communities vulnerable to the above drivers;\n• Lack of accountability, which is related to failures of land use planning and security of property (armed occupation of the park in the DRC, elites enabling dispossession of customary landholders in Uganda and lack of enforcement of existing fishing regulations and coastal zoning in Madagascar); and\n• Criminality related to wildlife trafficking and unsustainable hunting or fishing practices related to and amplified by extractive activities taking place.\n",

      "Document Title": "Building Livelihood Opportunities for Refugee Populations: Lessons from Past Practice ",
      "Key Findings": "Whether aid agencies and donors choose to invest in supply- or demand-side initiatives, the success of livelihood efforts is generally shaped by factors external to the programs themselves—factors that are often not accounted for in program design. These include in particular:\n1. The political and policy context in the host country.\n2. The types and extent of economic opportunities available in the host economy.\n3. The capacity and willingness of refugees to invest in livelihoods.",
      "Key Recommendations": "pg. 28 \n1. Provide more long-term and predictable funding. Many livelihood interventions aimed at refugees are still supported by funders and agencies used to working in humanitarian and relief contexts. Funding thus tends to be short-term and insufficient to effect real change. There is a need for humanitarian funding to commit to longer timeframes and to providing support to host communities, and for development agencies to support projects that also benefit refugees. Development and humanitarian agencies must improve the coordination of their interventions in conflict- and displacement-affected settings to\nmaximize the benefits of funding.\n\n2. More independent impact evaluations are needed. The evidence base is weak in terms of how livelihood programs impact the wellbeing, self-reliance, and durable solutions of refugees. Even principles currently considered best practices are not well established and have not been thoroughly evaluated in terms of whether and how they influence impact.\nPractices such as targeting vulnerable groups are not well conceptualized, and there is much debate and discussion over how (or even whether) such targeting should be used. Absent more substantial evidence and studies that examine whether specific practices lead\nto desired outcomes and stated goals, it is impossible to determine whether current refugee livelihood programming practices are having a positive and especially long-term impact.",

      "Document Title": "USAID/Albania Evaluation",
      "Key Findings": "The amount of work carried to produce financial reports and the trainings necessary to withstand work endured by staff to comply with USAID rules and regulations may dilute effort and detract from objectives. The lack of financial reserves provisions may hinder the financial independence of the local organizations. But, if implemented with caution and piloted to trusted partners, in the long run they may ensure a stronger civil society that will have more political courage to affect social change and stronger advocacy voices. Management and administrative capacities of IP’s staff are improved as a result of working with USAID Albania. The policies and procedures, internal control systems have been designed and implemented in a highly competent manner, guided by a coherent strategy.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Although reporting mechanism and robust internal systems and processes ensure accountability on the use of funds, more attention needs to be paid on ensuring NGO’s remain in touch with the realities and the needs the community they serve. Donors should include in their fund-raising training modules alternative fundraising mechanism, for example, crowdsourcing that can also increase communication and engagement with constituents and supporters of the causes NGOs are promoting. Additionally, the future projects supported by USAID Albania should have business sustainability as their primary goal since the advocacy and all activities rely on funding. Encourage the system of providing an endowment from donations by strengthening the role of board members to increase funds scrutiny, and setting clear guidelines on the ways and events when endowment funds can be used. Provided that the core objectives of the project are accomplished, less intrusive procedures4 from USAID Albania could be established.",

This brief explores private models of financing and delivering care, as well as public-private partnerships (PPPs) and joint ventures.   It also presents a range of community-level interventions led by private actors, demonstrating how the private sector can contribute to demand creation, PMTCT and antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery, and adherence and retention activities.   The discussion includes successes, lessons, and challenges that can inform the efforts of governments, donors, and implementers to adapt or replicate private sector models in new settings.  Effective engagement of private actors is critical to reaching global elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission (eMTCT) targets and achieving an AIDS-free generation.",

      "Key Findings": "This paper has six sections. Section I presents an overview of key findings and recommendations. Section II paints a picture of an effective 21st century U.S. development function. Section III provides a brief history of aid reform and sets out the principles upon which the paper is based. Section IV identifies elements of the current aid reform agenda that merit continued cultivation. Section V sets forth additional ideas for further action. Section VI outlines the need in the future for a mutual cooperation and partnering approach for U.S. global engagement as assistance declines as a source of development solutions.\n\nThe recommendations following each narrative generally are tiered in order of importance and impact, but not always. Certain suggestions serve as alternative options. This paper deals mainly with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which, as the principal U.S. development agency, has been at the center of the aid reform agenda. Other U.S. government agencies are brought into the analysis where they are relevant to specific issues.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations:\n• One-stop-shop: Business has long complained about having to go to multiple U.S. government agencies to find the one program that might support its interests and the slowness in working through the bureaucratic maze to get an answer, even a “no.” Power Africa reportedly has made interagency collaboration work—hosting multiple agencies at the same meeting with a U.S. company facilitates quick identification of which agencies might support the company’s planned project. This experience should be built upon to create a formal one-stop-shop, both online and a staffed office, for business looking for engagement with U.S. foreign affairs agencies, as would be authorized by S.3227, the Economic Growth and Development Act, introduced by Senator Johnny Isakson.\n• Comprehensive interagency engagement package: Short of a one-stop-shop, again building on the experience of Power Africa, a strategy and interagency capability should be created to provide an integrated business engagement package of support involving USAID, Department of State, USDA, OPIC, USTDA, Export-Import Bank, and the Commerce Department so as to provide comprehensive support for engaging U.S. companies in development activities.\n• Evaluation of PPPs: A formal assessment of USAID’s PPPs should be undertaken, both as a mechanism for engaging the private sector and as a way to produce development results. Assess the impact of PPPs, the sustainability of results, the measurement of outcomes, and the value of the GDA model, including whether the 1:1 finance match requirement is beneficial or a distraction. Analyze the roles of commercial interest and shared value in a partnership to determine whether they are key indicators of the likelihood of sustainability and should serve as filters in assessing prospective partnerships. Review the role and value of dedicated relationship managers and whether they should be full-time positions.\n• Strategic engagement: Using the experience of the BAA, assess how to better engage the private sector in strategic discussions in the design phase of programs and policies.",

The agricultural machinery that was introduced by CSISA-MI allowed for a natural experiment in what characteristics facilitate adoption and scaling up because of the simultaneous introduction of several machines.  The CSISA-MI project introduced many approaches to project design and implementation that facilitated commercially sustainable scaling up.  The CSISA-MI project did not do formal studies of market size or the business cases for the various machines prior to the start of the project.",

These include the emergence of a window of opportunity in the form of either a focusing event (e.g. food crisis) or an institutional shift (e.g. new president or new ruling party) that coincides with broad stakeholder support for empirically-grounded alternatives, available material resources, and sustained commitment from politically important policymakers.",

      "Key Recommendations": " USAID should deploy border management and trade experts to southern Africa to identify key interventions and their sequence.\n USAID should facilitate a workshop between key stakeholders in South Africa to understand the practical implications (e.g., ownership of cargo at points along the supply chain) of the new\ncustoms legislation that is expected to enter into force in 2017.\n USAID should host a joint study tour for South African officials and private-sector representatives to consider the experience of other countries, such as Australia, Canada and the U.S., in establishing a BMA.\n USAID should identify potential private-sector associations that it can support through capacity building initiatives, project support, research, training, etc. to advocate more effectively on TF issues at the national and regional levels.\n USAID should work with South African stakeholders to develop a model for an authority for the North-South Corridor.",

Addressing Constraints to Trade in key staples (grain, beans, e.g.) is an important Feed the Future goal that underpins USAID regional mission programs and implicitly many FTF bilateral projects.  As developing country food systems modernize and increasing numbers of urban consumers demand safe, high-quality food, SPS and food safety issues take on greater importance.  A hallmark of FTF’s value chain approach is linking small farmers to markets.  Feed the Future has focused largely on staple food crop value chains in selected ZOIs, but there is increasing investment in diversification through USAID projects and programs in horticulture, livestock (including dairy, poultry), and high-value cash crops such as coffee and cotton.",

While FTFMS data show that most value chains are on target to meet fiscal year (FY) 2016 and/or FY 2017 outcome-level targets and that Feed the Future assisted many smallholders to expand their production of staple and micronutrient-dense crops, the sustainability of those outcomes with respect to agricultural productivity in some countries has been negatively impacted due to the effects of the recent El Niño.  All four indicators measuring IR 8 (improved use of maternal and child nutrition services) displayed a positive trend in aggregate performance and overall, the portfolio reviews show that almost all focus countries are on track to meet the FY 2016 portfolio review target on nutritional impact and activity-level results.",

      "Key Findings": "• Market-oriented activities conducted either by partners or by beneficiaries have a higher likelihood of enduring than non-market-oriented partnerships.\n• PPPs designed around a core business opportunity for a profit-driven partner have a high likelihood of creating enduring results.\n• By contrast, partnerships with profit-seeking partners engaging in CSR activities that are not linked to their core business – whether market- oriented or non-market-oriented – are less likely to achieve sustainability. \n• The private sector played a critical role in nine partnerships of the eleven that sustained and scaled.\n• Private sector relationships are most additive as an asset when used to create market linkages.\n• Not surprisingly, of the six instances where the private sector actor could have been any type of actor, our did not sustain.\n• Policy change can be particularly effective when combining private sector assets with government capabilities.\n• Capacity-building produces enduring results only in conjunction with a different pathway to sustainability.\n• Partnerships that achieve policy change demonstrate strong potential to both sustain and scale, without requiring additional funding.\n• Partnerships with corporations that have a strong local presence are more likely to have results that are financially self-sustaining.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Intentionally pursue more market-oriented partnerships with\nprivate sector partners. These partnerships should provide critical additionality (ideally through the relationships and/or specialized capabilities of private sector partners) and chart a clear path to sustainability and scale at the outset.\n2. Strengthen USAID practitioners’ and partners’ understanding of expectations for sustainability and scale in USAID’s PPPs.\n3. Modify internal partnership data collection and/or analysis to track sustainability and scale outcomes.\n4. Promote knowledge sharing and peer-to-peer learning on partnership sustainability.\n5. Incorporate key success factors for market-oriented pathways to achieve sustainability and scale.\n6. Ensure continuity of people involved or the transfer of key information in design and especially implementation.\n7. Build checkpoints on sustainability into ongoing partnership processes – and course-correct as needed.\n8. Be intentional about scale during planning and implementation.\n9. Gather insights on implementation by incorporating select metrics into the annual data collection cycle and/or partnership health surveys that are conducted periodically.\n10. Incentivize midterm reporting on progress toward goals for sustainability and scale.\n11. Set expectations for ex-post reporting.\n12. Create incentives for ex-post reporting.\n",

      "Key Findings": "Since the 1990s China has emerged as one of the world’s most active markets for public-private partnerships (PPPs) in water and sanitation, while the private sector has played a rather limited role in the water sector in India. From 2001 to 2012, there were 237 PPP projects in water and sanitation in China, accounting for 40% of the total number of such projects globally, and the Chinese population served by private water companies increased from merely 8% in 1989 to 38% in 2008. Development of PPPs in the water sector in India during the same period was\ninsignificant. Our comparative analysis of PPPs in water and sanitation in the two countries highlights the importance of water tariff reform, strong support and oversight from the national government, and the availability of credible regulatory mechanisms to safeguard development and sustainability of PPPs in the water sector.\n",

PPP has a long history in developed countries, but the approach has only recently gained attention as a method for boosting economic growth and development in developing countries. The article argues that the companies‘ motivation for participating in PPP in Somalia extends beyond the conventional objective of commercial considerations to the moral imperative of supporting members of the umma (community), despite considerable risks, and is at the forefront of Turkey‘s interest in Africa.",

Embedding certain governance mechanisms in PPP contracting and management is necessary to foster both financial and non- financial sustainability in healthcare provided via PPPs. Some countries and some PPPs have managed to develop suitable mechanisms to govern the conflicting goals in healthcare management.",

      "Document Summary": "This document discussed international and German development corporations that develop projects with the private sector. Their goal is to provide long term benefits to local populations with the projects they take on. This evaluation follows a theory-based approach to finding the best ways to conduct private sector projects. The research mainly looks at the developePPP.de programme and found that their projects have difficulty with the effectiveness within the development sector. The developePPP.de programme, established in 1999, is featured as the largest and most important support system for development partnerships with the private sector. The document recommends the corporations focus on project objectives, design and implementation to promote the relevance of the projects. \n",
      "Key Findings": "The prominent position of develoPPP.de as BMZ’s major programme for promoting development partnerships with the private sector makes it possible to enlist support from private companies in achieving sustainable development goals, in addition to the classical stakeholders at state and civil-society level. Via its projects, the programme contributes to knowledge and technology transfer in developing countries and emerging economies. The project results endure beyond the end of the project term, but rarely extend beyond the project level. The develoPPP.de programme promotes a large number of stand-alone projects, despite its original intention of providing impetus to enhance performance across entire systems. In its current form, the programme has difficulty meeting the high demands for development effectiveness.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• BMZ is advised to continue the programme. This should be done under the proviso that it takes a clear position vis-à-vis the programme’s objectives and that the programme be consolidated and given a corresponding strategic orientation. In this context, it should be made\nclear whether cooperation with the private sector and the related function of maintaining a dialogue with companies and sensitising them to development issues represents added value in itself (which must be more\nprecisely defined), or whether the added value of the programme should be attained exclusively by achieving development results in the partner countries.\n• BMZ should make clear the extent to which there is a division of labour with bilateral DC programmes and other BMZ programmes on cooperation with the private sector, and the extent to which these programmes can be linked up. It should draw up a policy paper on this\nsubject that explicitly defines and regulates cooperation with the private sector.\n• BMZ should adjust the programme design based on a consolidated set of objectives. Existing conflicts between private sector and development-policy interests should be spelled out to make clear whether synergies can be leveraged, and where there are limits as regards orientation towards the intended objectives. This should be supported via a dialogue between BMZ and the private sector.\n• The programme design needs to be adjusted with regard\nto two core aspects: (1) Strengthening the programme’s function of sensitising the private sector to development issues and engaging\nin a corresponding dialogue; (2) Strengthening orientation towards development priorities and impacts in the partner countries. The possible adjustments proposed here are not mutually exclusive: some of them can be made in parallel.\n• To make full use of existing potentials, it is recommended that project implementation and the acquisition of partner companies be systematically aligned with the core competencies of the implementing\norganisations. Within the implementing organisations, every effort should therefore be made to dovetail activities more closely with key business segments.\n• The existing forms of cooperation should be retained, but a greater distinction should be made between them, and they should be aligned with the expertise of the individual implementing organisations.",

      "Key Findings": "Coastal areas, and those with mangroves in particular, present unique planning challenges, with overlapping resource rights regimes. Given the high value and wide-range of sectoral economic interests, as well as the importance of coastal resources for subsistence livelihoods, multi-sectoral spatial planning provides a powerful tool to identify real or potential conflicts and to support negotiated agreements. Privatization of mangrove areas to individual households or organizations introduces a risk of excluding legitimate users. As a result, co-management governance structures of mangrove forest that integrate diverse user groups provide a potential structure to balance multiple social, ecological and economic objectives in managing this system. The Vietnam pilot demonstrates the appetite of local stakeholders for these structures and their ability to acquire the technical mapping and facilitation skills to develop their own coastal spatial development plans.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Implementors of participatory coastal mapping activities must engage with authorities at every level.\n2. Based on the above experiences, the pilot recommends engaging with key cross-sectoral stakeholders on coastal spatial planning and mangrove management going forward from local to provincial levels.\n3. Allow new participants to join throughout the process.\n4. Participatory coastal resource planning is most useful in areas where there are complex and competing land use needs.\n5. When seeking the support and engagement of various community\nstakeholders, as well as the private sector, the implementer should have a clear understanding of how the activity will benefit each group and be able to articulate it effectively.",

The study found that today a public-private partnership is in the process of its formation in the Republic of Kalmykia. In the near future there is need to carry out substantial and systematic work on the development of partnership and improvement of regulatory legal base, regulating the issues of property rights, sharing risks and responsibility; the creation of a specialized structure, responsible for the development and coordination of the interaction between the state (municipal) agencies and private businesses; the training of highly qualified specialists among the employees of the regional and municipal levels, as well as the issue of financial security of projects.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Regional governments should provide guarantees to attract private sector investments and stimulate engagement in Public-Private Partnerships (PPP).\n\nRegional Center for Development, the goal of which is to spur collaboration among experts to design PPP implementation methods, should be formed.",

In turn, this inhibits our understanding of when and why ISPs are chosen by governments, what underlies key moments of innovation within these programs, and the main criteria for their sustainability. The Kaleidoscope Model helps fill this void by providing a set of focused and tractable hypotheses to address these dynamics and thereby guide the efforts of those donors, researchers, and national governments concerned with improving the effectiveness of such programs over tim",

      "Key Findings": "In the last decade, Chile has prioritized export promotion policies for the service sector as a result of global dynamism of trade in services and the need for diversification of the Chilean economy towards higher value-added industries. This study evaluates the results and identifies the factors that explain the performance of the public-private partnership implemented in Chile to promote architectural services. The analysis suggests a poor performance, mainly as a result of the inertia on the preservation of strategies developed for goods to intangibles as services, affecting the design and implementation of the programs; also, the private sector presents, among others, collective action and associativity issues that limit the capability to develop market research and business models. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "For future studies, it would be interesting to verify some of the hypotheses that emerge from this research. For example, to analyze if the learning costs absorbed by the PPP, as being one of the first in the service sector, were indeed overcome in the design and implementation of subsequent Sectoral Brands. On the other hand, considering the general framework of the PPP, it seems necessary to evaluate the trade promotion policy for Chilean services export in the last decade in Chile, to the extent that there is an evident public speech that places this sector as a priority within trade policy, which is questionable in the light of the findings of this research.",

Such plans can help raise awareness of the benefits of risk reduction and financial protection by engaging a wide range of stakeholders, including members of civil society.\n\n3. Promote institutional and legal frameworks that enable the implementation of financial protection strategies. This includes creating the legal base that enables governments to establish disaster risk management funds, pay insurance premium and manage insurance proceeds, and join supranational financial entities such as catastrophe risk pools.\n\n4. Develop new concessional financing for catastrophe risk transfer instruments to incentivize vulnerable developing countries to develop and adopt sustainable financial protection strategies.",

Growth:\n• Promote the cultivation and crop protection (pests and disease) of bio-fortified food crops that are adapted to farming systems in the Karamoja Region.\n• Pivot to include adolescents in training on life skills and business management to create employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for girls and boys as alternatives to early marriage and pregnancy.\n\n2. Health and Nutrition:\n• Continue partnerships with the District Health Office (DHO) to assist with planning and budgeting of health facilities and services with a five-year health plan for the districts.\n• Upgrade the capacity of the village health team (VHT)/community health workers (CHW) with appropriate IT tools for better delivery of information and services to the households.\n\n3. Governance:\n• Continue to reduce the number of conflicts with continued support to peace groups, youth-led community based organizations (YCOB) and government agencies.\n• Support women’s involvement in decision-making in mitigating the impacts of climate change because\nwomen are mainly responsible for food production and are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\n",

      "Key Findings": "• First, the nature of the USAID design process coupled with EAC protocols often means that experienced line staff implementing projects at the EAC and within Partner States, are not included in the design phase of projects.\n\n• Secondly, M&E systems across most activities are perceived as inadequate, focusing on outputs rather than outcomes.\n\n• Third, PREPARED lacked an effective overall community strategy for engaging and communicating with stakeholders including EAC Partner States and regional organizations, on project matters.\n\n• Fourth, in several instances, custom indicators for the PREPARED M&E plan may have better reflected the project's strengths and weaknesses. Indicators reflected outputs rather than outcomes.\n\n• Finally, the team found that most activities will require an accelerated effort to become sustainable after PREPARED support ends.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. It is recommended that USAID/KEA makes a concerted effort to facilitate a more inclusive project design process for regional programs.\n\n2. It is recommended that an outcome-based M&E system be established.\n\n3. It is recommended that PREPARED should compile a living\ndocument to illustrate lessons learned throughout the project’s life.\n\n4. It is recommended that USAID/KEA use such custom indicators for projects similar to PREPARED.\n\n5. It is recommended that this become the primary focus for the remaining life of the project.",

      "Document Title": "Mobilising Private Adaptation Finance: Developed Country Perspectives",
      "Key Findings": "The private sector is one of the sources of finance included in developed countries’ pledge in the UN climate negotiations to mobilise $100 billion annually by 2020 to support developing countries’ efforts to address climate change. For adaptation in particular, it remains unclear what mobilised private finance is. Research so far has focused on its potential and experiences in developing countries, but not on the arguments of those who introduced and continue to advocate private adaptation finance: developed countries. This paper investigates the positions of developed countries and development banks and agencies. In particular, it aims to identify whether those actors can reach a common understanding of private adaptation finance that minimises norm conflicts in a fragmented climate finance system. Empirically, the paper examines the Biennial Reports and submissions on Strategies and Approaches for Mobilising Scaled-up Finance of six developed country parties, as well as data from interviews with experts from development banks and agencies. The analysis finds a number of discrepancies between these sets of actors, for example on motivations for and modes of private sector involvement. This discrepancy is the result of ambiguity around the concept of private adaptation finance in a highly fragmented climate finance architecture. This ambiguity is problematic when the aim of mobilising private adaptation finance is to contribute to the $100 billion commitment. However, if the aim is adaptation in practice, both ambiguity and fragmentation might actually make the climate finance system more inclusive and innovative",
      "Key Recommendations": "However, if the aim of mobilising private finance is to reach the $100 billion commitment, the climate finance system requires a more static and integrated architecture.\n\nAlternatively, the aim could be output: maximising the mobilisation of effective private investments (rather than finance) in resilience and reducing vulnerability, regardless of whether these constitute climate finance or not.\n\nRather than being fixated on reaching the $100 billion commitment, the climate finance system should aim for adaptation output. This might also enhance innovation and include more actors in the system.",

      "Key Findings": "The main findings and conclusions underscore the considerable contributions that SIAPS and its collaborating partners made towards organizing, regulating and controlling the purchase, storage and distribution of Angola's medical supplies. After conducting an initial assessment, SIAPS identified key gaps in the Angolan public supply chain (SC) systems, which included: inadequate coordination of SC stakeholder efforts and the lack of a national coordination mechanism or platform; the lack of a national SC strategy; the lack of a national medicines regulatory system; suboptimal logistics management information systems (LMIS); poor availability and lack of a culture of consistent use of data to inform decision-making; and inadequate performance measurement and monitoring for improvement across all levels of the SC system.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Primary recommendations include: stronger advocacy by USAID, including urging the GRA Ministry of Health to approve and implement SIAPS policy documents and manuals (see Annex V), and to maintain USAID’s engagement with and advocacy of the government. Continued cooperation among implementing partners and stakeholders (a practice inaugurated by SIAPS) is encouraged as it presents opportunities for increasing both human and non-human resources and coordination. Additional training and resources are needed, both to maintain the systems and staffing that SIAPS put into place, and to strengthen the coordination and management of Angola’s pharmaceutical delivery system throughout the country, particularly in the provinces and municipalities.",

      "Key Findings": "Both the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) represent bold initiatives to address systematically gaps in previous efforts to assure that societies can be resilient when confronted with potentially overwhelming threats to health. Despite their obvious differences, and differing criticisms of both, they shift away from vertical (problem-or disease-specific) to horizontal (comprehensive) solutions. Despite the comprehensiveness of the SDGs, they lack a specific target for global health security. The GHSA focuses primarily on infectious diseases and neglects non communicable diseases and socioeconomic drivers of health. Even though each agenda has limitations and unique challenges, they are complementary. We discuss ways to understand and implement the two agendas synergistically to hasten progress toward a more sustainable and resilient world.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Increase financial support for SDGs and GHSA implementation by enhancing private sector engagement and domestic resource mobilization and allocation.\n\n2. Increase fiscal support for SDGs and GHSA by encouraging OECD countries to achieve their target Overseas Development\nAid (ODA) of 0.7 per cent as agreed by donor nations at high-level international development conferences and by mobilizing G20 nations (an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 20 major economies founded in 1999 to study, review, and promote high-level discussion of policy issues about international financial stability) to allocate greater resources toward health.\n\n3. Engage civil society for GHSA advocacy and support.\n\n4. Facilitate implementation of SDGs and the GHSA through incentives and by developing five-year plans.\n\n5. Enhance governance structures to include political accountability for IHR implementation during outbreaks and ensure transparency for SDG implementation.",

      "Key Findings": "Analysis in this study focuses on private sector actors that have a humanitarian role. In both contexts, the private sector has facilitated access to humanitarian aid, leveraged its own resources and distributed assistance (cash and otherwise) to affected communities. In Yemen, a microfinance bank has used its established networks across the country to distribute cash assistance and has collaborated with humanitarian actors such as the Red Cross. Two of Yemen’s largest business groups have taken on responsibility for distributing food and other resources. In Somalia, the private sector delivers humanitarian commodities under contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Private sector actors and humanitarian organizations have also collaborated in delivering cash-based programming via the hawala money transfer network.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Key recommendations across the two countries include:\n• Strengthen the links between local and international businesses, and between business and the humanitarian sector.\n• Convene discussions to chart constructive responses\nto counter-terror requirements.\n• Actively integrate business engagement in humanitarian action within the wider corporate sustainability movement and lexicon.\n• Networking networks: convene business networks at country and regional levels.\n• Understand the links between private sector and market-based approaches in complex emergencies.",

The safety net system or social assistance programs, were scaled up to provide relief to the most vulnerable, in the form of cash transfer top-up payments.\nWhile the national social protection system was used to channel humanitarian relief in the form of cash vouchers to the affected families. The interplay between the social protection and humanitarian assistance efforts in Fiji, presents a compelling case for synchronizing and\ncomplementing relief efforts in the future. And, a set of recommendations have been put forward for consideration, for strengthening future disaster responsive social protection.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on the experiences of TC Winston and the lessons learnt, the following recommendations can be put forward for the Government’s consideration moving forward, for a stronger and resilient disaster response framework.\n1) Develop an institutionalized (formal) Social Protection Policy Framework, with an embedded disaster responsive component.\n2) Develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOP’s) and guidelines for disaster responsive social protection.\n3) Establish a coordination mechanism for cash transfer interventions in times of disaster.\n4) Consolidate and centralize the Poverty Benefit Scheme (PBS) database so that both poor and near-poor households can be targeted in times of disaster. \n5) Complement humanitarian assistance with both in-kind and cash assistance, based on access and functionality of local markets.\n6) Develop a Post-Disaster Communication Plan.\n7) Explore options for Disaster Risk Financing for Fiji.\n",

This means that the apparel industry in Haiti supports a total of 65,892 jobs throughout the economy in the form of:\n\n• 41,000 apparel industry jobs,\n• 11,456 jobs with companies in the supply chain supporting the industry , and\n• 13,437 jobs supported by workers spending their wages in the community.\nThese are largely net new jobs because the revenue that supports them comes from abroad and not from Haitian consumers. In calculating job impacts, we varied certain key inputs to see how the estimates could vary under different economic conditions.\n",

      "Key Findings": "1. Delivering humanitarian cash transfers through mobile money\ncreates potential opportunities to connect recipients with broader digital financial services, but does not automatically lead to widespread or sustained uptake. People may prefer to continue using informal financial systems that are more familiar, accessible and profitable.\n2. In the case studies looked at in this research, exposure to mobile\nmoney through humanitarian cash transfers was not sufficient to enable recipients previously unfamiliar with mobile money to conduct transactions independently.\n3. Given that the priorities of humanitarian responses are to meet urgent needs, a disaster or crisis may not be the most appropriate time to invest in building digital literacy.\n4. Aid agencies should still be able to use mobile money delivery systems when they are the most efficient, accessible and transparent way to deliver humanitarian cash transfers.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Recognise that improving the digital literacy of people new to mobile technology requires continued training and opportunities to practice, which may not be appropriate or a priority in short-term humanitarian programmes.\n2. Assess demand for digital financial services (e.g. savings, money transfers) before investing in activities to improve uptake and recognise that recipients may prefer to continue using other financial services that they consider more relevant and accessible.\n3. Ensure that recipients unfamiliar with mobile technologies have adequate support to cash out their transfers during the project, for instance dedicated NGO staff and helpdesks.\n4. Monitor mobile money agents’ liquidity to ensure that lack of cash does not significantly affect programme quality or restrict participants’ choices.\n5. Consider ways to support mobile phone purchases, including through loans, payment plans and subsidies.\n6. Assess and mitigate gender-specific constraints, such as women’s access to phones and mobile money agents.",

      "Document Title": "Value chain development with the extremely poor: evidence and lessons from CARE, Save the Children, and World Vision",
      "Key Findings": "The majority of the world’s poorest people live in South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa. Most of these households engage in rural farming and subsist on incomes at or below the international extreme poverty line of US$1.90 per person per day (our working definition for the ‘extremely poor’) (FAO, 2015). CARE, Save the Children, and World Vision are applying inclusive value chain development (VCD) among households living in extreme poverty in an effort to catalyse sustained food security. In this article, we discuss how VCD can be applied with the extremely poor and how five levers of change can improve livelihoods: 1) capacity; 2) access; 3) productivity; 4) household influence; and 5) enabling environment. We describe examples of how market-based approaches can be utilized effectively to enhance food security. Although they may be distinctive at points, we highlight the complementary approaches and outcomes utilized by CARE, Save the Children, and World Vision in facilitating VCD. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Focus capacity building on sustainable access to information. The most vulnerable farmers need special support – such as lead farmers and women-focused extension – to access information in order to be able to increase yields and negotiate prices. Do not assume that all information channels are appropriate for the extremely poor, especially women, and tailor interventions accordingly. VSLAs can help extremely poor households build their productive assets and social capital over time. Training programmes help extremely poor households build their capacity to enter markets over time.\n\n2. Bring markets to the poor. Design ways to reduce cost and distance between extremely poor farmers and input suppliers, rather than assume that these farmers can overcome barriers on their own. Some successful interventions explored in this article include village agents, agri-kiosks, input fairs, buying centres and agro-dealers.\n\n3. Increase women’s influence to make decisions. Simply adding women participants to programmes is not enough. Increased production and income must be combined with increasing women’s influence over all household decisions. Women need to be empowered to increase their mobility, control income, make nutrition and health choices, and have increased access to extension.\n\n4. Change gender norms. Women’s access and capacity need to be supported by broader forces. Community leaders’ attitudes towards gender need to change to allow for more equitable decision-making processes at the household level. Men need to get involved in sharing women’s heavy labour burdens.\n\n5. Think beyond our silo. Value chains and economic development cannot stand alone. The poorest people face a variety of obstacles, including malnutrition, lack of education, and poor water and sanitation, that must also be addressed to sustain improvements in the food security indicators, such as a reduction of stunting. VCD activities need to operate with these additional sectors in project design or in collaboration with other public and private efforts in these sectors. ",

      "Key Findings": "Over 75 percent of adults living in countries with humanitarian crises remain outside of the formal financial system and struggle to respond to shocks and emergencies, build up productive assets, and invest in health, education, and business. Demand for financial services in crisis contexts, however, is high.\n\nExisting evidence suggests that access to financial services can strengthen the resilience of individuals and households in the face of negative shocks and significantly contribute to supporting livelihoods and stimulating economic activity after a crisis or disaster. Remittances help maintain consumption during difficult periods and contribute positively to local economic activity. Savings, whether formal or informal, can provide a form of self-insurance and thus help people to weather economic shocks without resorting to negative coping mechanisms such as assets depletion and child labor.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Leveraging financial services as a tool to mitigate humanitarian crises requires the sustained commitment of Financial Services Providers (FSPs) \n2. Investing in host country systems and capacity to manage crisis by leveraging financial services should be prioritized \n3. Donors need to play a role in building deliberate linkages between humanitarian and development efforts through financial services provision \n4. Further evidence is needed to better understand the demand for and use of financial services by different segments of populations affected by crises.  ",

      "Document Title": "Are public-private partnerships the solution to tackle neglected tropical diseases? A systematic review of the literature",
      "Key Findings": "Pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to invest in research and development (R&D) of products for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) mainly due to the low ability-to-pay of health insurance systems and of potential consumers. The available preventive and curative interventions for NTDs mostly rely on old technologies and products that are often not adequate. Moreover, NTDs mostly affect populations living in remote rural areas and conflict zones, thereby hampering access to healthcare. The challenges posed by\nNTDs have led to the proliferation of a variety of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the last decades. We conducted a systematic review to assess the functioning and impact of these partnerships on the development of and access to better technologies for NTDs. Our systematic review revealed a clear lack of empirical assessment of PPPs: we could not find any impact evaluation analyses, while these are crucial to realize the full potential of PPPs and to progress further towards NTDs elimination.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To deal with this lack of transparency and ensuing shortage of data, one could require partnerships to register on a single platform, on which partners would have to declare all funding received; investments made; starting and ending dates of each clinical step; etc. This incentive to the public provision of information on partnership could be enhanced by a scheme, as suggested in the literature: “transparency in exchange for public funds.”\n\nIn addition to the lack of data, the research is challenged by the absence of a counterfactual to which PPPs for NTDs could be compared; as it is unlikely to see non-PPP models for diseases that mainly affect the poor. However, assessing how different characteristics of PPPs – such as geographic coverage, stakeholders involved, funding and governance structure – affect the desired outcome would already provide good insights into how the model could be optimized; shedding light on the drivers of their success or failure.",

      "Key Findings": "A few general trends were observed from the selection of fourteen case studies reviewed. These observations indicate the interesting but somewhat limited types of market support programs currently implanted by humanitarian practitioners:\n• Market support is largely implemented as cash grants to small traders.\n• Both formal (registered) and informal traders are recipients of market support.\n• Most market support programs impose conditions or restrictions on the money they distribute.\n• Market support by international actors is highly subsidized.\n• Market support programs may include trainings or other soft components.",
      "Key Recommendations": "By gathering context-specific examples of programs that support market actors, market services, and the market environment during emergencies, this review begins to meet the need for more evidence-based guidelines for designing and implementing market-based programming. It is also meant to generate more creative response analysis by showcasing what has been done successfully in the past. There are significant opportunities for increased numbers and improved quality of market support programs in  humanitarian sector, building on successes and challenges to date. The humanitarian community should continue to gather lessons learned and grow the evidence base around market support programs, to continue to develop this type of programming in humanitarian response.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Consider the creation or utilization of existing communication and knowledge management platforms within USG to share knowledge about the experience of Enterprise Funds and Legacy Foundations. \n2. An even more structured alternative to knowledge sharing would be a consolidation of the management of the Enterprise Funds. \n3. Define what a reasonable expectation from the Funds in terms of effecting development impact would be and what appropriate and sufficient reporting metrics would be expected. \n4. Consider setting up a structure such as an Advisory Board of professionals with relevant private equity, venture capital, commercial and investment banking, advisory and legal experience as well as retired USAID personnel.\n5. Consider using legal counsel with experience in private equity and the financial industry when negotiating contracts and compensation plans with Enterprise Funds’ Boards.\n",

      "Key Findings": "• Design and effectiveness: The effectiveness of the program was constrained by the limited capacity of IPs to influence its two most critical aspects: beneficiary numbers and graduate numbers.\n\n• MCHN/WASH: DFAP messaging has proved effective in changing attitudes.\n\n• Capacity development: Current approaches to capacity development, although much appreciated, are constrained by staff turnover.\n\n• Graduation: For the poorer households, progress towards graduation is slow and not dramatically enhanced by community assets or MCHN/WASH activities.\n\n• Gender equality and empowerment: Progress is inherently gradual; nevertheless, repetition and a diversified “multichannel” approach have proven effective, especially when Health Extension Workers (HEWs) and schools have been involved.\n\n• Program management and sustainability: The capacity of management to coordinate different interventions within a layered approach has definitely enhanced program outcomes.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1.To achieve program goals and objectives: \nConsider the reinstatement of full family targeting and fortified vegetable oil in the ration, as well as the introduction of variable month transfers (3–6–9), depending upon household needs.\n2. To enhance the graduation process:\nAdvocate for a more comprehensive role for IPs in the graduation process from which they are currently excluded, especially in the application of the GPS and targeting processes. \n3. To strengthen the DFAPs’ contribution to gender equity: \nDFAPs should continue the process of empowerment, reaching out to both men and women through social behavior change communication (SBCC), while strengthening girl’s and women’s education. \n4. To strengthen program management: \nM&E units should reduce the number of output indicators and increase the use of small KPC (Knowledge, Practice, and Coverage) Surveys and other assessments to guide management on a more frequent basis.\n5. To enhance program sustainability: \nIncreased emphasis is required on family planning.\n",

They have been drawn in a general policy framework of a liberalized, free market economy. However, in principle, where markets fail to result into optimal prices or quantities, the state plays an important role in clearing market failures, as evidenced by the 1929 and 2008 financial crises.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. A national medicine price monitoring system should be instituted throughout the supply chain.\n2. The indicative medicine prices derived from routine surveys should be routinely published and made widely available for the public.\n3. MoH initiative of providing recommended retail prices for medicines should be scaled up to cover a broader range of communicable and non-communicable diseases.",

      "Key Recommendations": "First, the use of public finance to subsidize, guarantee or leverage private finance should be carefully evaluated: a review led by developing country stakeholders, under the auspices of the UN, could be a good start.\n\nSecond, the international community has to tackle the perverse incentives in favour of PPPs.\n\nThird, there is a need for a standard-setting process for PPPs to take place in an inclusive and transparent way.",

      "Key Findings": "EHELD was successful in establishing CoEs at both universities, including: updating curricula and developing specialized fields of study, upgrading laboratory equipment and resource rooms, providing scholarships to nearly 300 students and 22 faculty members to acquire degrees in target fields, and facilitating 29 CF to teach at the two colleges to enhance quality through provision of new classes and capacity building support for local faculty (LF).  \nOne of the primary challenges of EHELD was the complex relationship between the implementing partner (IP) and the other various stakeholders, including the two beneficiary universities, as well as the three US-based universities involved as consortium partners.EHELD’s consortium members worked in close collaboration with all stakeholders to offer an updated, comprehensive, and specialized learning experience for students, including the development of three professional specializations at the Center for Agriculture and Sustainable Development (CASD) and integrating active learning approaches.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The CoEs are strong assets that should be supported to transition to locally-owned entities, as they work to implement sustainability strategies to maintain their status as premier educational institutions in their select fields. Continue to explore innovative strategies to make school fees affordable for students, and other funding sources to reduce dependency on school fees (FFS, research grants, etc.). Train students and faculty to perform routine maintenance on equipment, where appropriate, to reduce maintenance costs. Explore strategies to increase awareness and utilization of valuable CoE resources, such as lab equipment, among relevant partners. Expand the role of the internship coordinator to network with the PS, so that the university can start facilitating support for graduates to find jobs.",

      "Key Findings": "• Sustainability of democratic processes requires systemic changes and interventions that address all components, elements and stakeholders in the policy cycle.\n\n• Sustainability of change requires systematic oversight of policy and budget making processes, to avoid pro forma processes.\n\n• Citizen participation depends primarily on the awareness and commitment of local politicians to engaging citizens and capacities and the enthusiasm of community leaders.\n\n• A tailor-made, well-designed and expertly implemented local grant scheme can assist the translation of project ideas that tackle specific local concerns or problems into sustainable interventions that have an impact on people’s lives.\n\n• Support provided for strengthening organizational capacities and improving policy-focused advocacy strategy can result in legislative changes in specific issue areas, as has been the case in regulating protection from and prevention of domestic violence and introducing needed services.\n\n•  CSO sustainability and the sustainability of their initiatives show creative ways that local organizations have persevered from social enterprise creation to technical assistance provision.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Any future program aimed at strengthening democratic processes should target, at the same time, the government, private and civil sectors, in a well-coordinated manner, as well as during all phases and with all stakeholders of the policy cycle.\n\n2. Any future programming should emphasize this role while having realistic expectations of capacities and political context possibilities amongst CSOs and citizens.\n\n3. A key focus of future efforts should be raising the awareness of and building the capacities of Mayors, their teams and members of local councils to embrace and support participatory processes and understand the benefits it brings - on strengthening the knowledge and skills of current leadership.\n\n4. Future efforts should be modeled on the best practices of a local grant scheme that has flexibility and close collaboration with the communities.\n\n5. Any future efforts should consider the extent to which legislative changes are of interest to all sides and can be prioritized in specific issue areas.\n\n6. Any future effort should keep in mind the variety of forms sustainability can take, and support innovative approaches to fostering both organizational and issue sustainability.\n",

It clearly demonstrated that the combined animal health and extension services as provided by paravets, substantially reduced mortality in adult and young stock, while enhancing the off-farm sales.\nIn the study area, the North-western region of Afghanistan, over\n95% of the veterinary field personnel were paravets providing private veterinary and extension services. The remainder consisted of higher qualified veterinary staff. The results of the present study are supportive for the choices made in the early stages of the program as to focus on intermediate level of veterinary auxiliary personnel (para-professionals) with additional skills like extension activities trained for over time.",

      "Key Findings": "General conclusions drawn from multiple cases include:\n\n1. An analysis of multimodal programming expects that there may often be multiple “right” responses in a given context. It is because the various goods and services needed may involve different supply chains with different regulatory environments (imported commodities, locally produced commodities, telecoms, banks,\netc.), shock affectedness, and cultural contexts (including willingness to pay) that different modalities may be appropriate.\n\n2. Despite these differences, the general information categories needed for response analysis are quite similar across sectors suggesting that a harmonized approach to response analysis would be appropriate.\n \n3. Interestingly, the case studies did not demonstrate financial cost savings as a major decision-making factor for choosing between cash, vouchers, or in-kind assistance. Rather than cost, the most influential arguments in deciding a given modality mix included: time to delivery, organizational capacity (human resource availability or experience), market supply response capacity (trader capacity), security, and beneficiary preference.\n\n4. Respondents felt the human-resource cost of preparing or maintaining multiple pipelines for more or less simultaneous delivery was high, suggesting that it may not be reasonable to assume efficiencies through simultaneous distribution of these multiple types of goods and services, particularly at the beginning\nof a project or in a true emergency context (Nepal, Guatemala). On the other hand, switching modalities once multiple pipelines and products are established is relatively straightforward (Canada, South Sudan, Myanmar, DRC).\n\n5. Careful assessment and validation; slow, progressive change; and well-communicated contingency planning contribute to trust and change acceptance. Engaging stakeholders in rigorous situation and response analysis contributes to acceptance and trust and is particularly important in volatile and sensitive contexts.",

USAID’s focus on Health Systems Strengthening/Capacity Building (HSS/CB) has been a relatively sound strategy for improving and expanding HIV/AIDS services in South Africa. DSPs have positively contributed to strengthening the six health system building blocks in their respective districts, but most especially the 3 building blocks of service delivery, health workforce, and information management.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Engage in a transparent and open dialogue with Provincial DOHs about USAID’s mandate to, and expectations of, the partners it finances in the province.\n2. Support DOH in improving overall HR Performance Management\n3. Align PEPFAR and DOH planning/implementation processes and MER indicators/processes.\n4. Continue to support M&E to address critical capacity gaps and data backlogs.\n5. Identify key HSS/CB indicators to be reported on by DSPs when technical assistance/capacity building is the main focus of the project.\n6. Review the performance of districts that have “graduated” from DSP support to identify lessons learned and success/sustainability factors.\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "Although this is not an evaluation of the management performance of USAID/CAM, based on all the findings related to the effectiveness of the Strategy and each one of its activities, mentioned in Section 4.2 it is recommendable to emphasize that implementation of activities be more than managing a contract or an award with an IP. It should include an active process of defining realistic expected results, monitoring progress toward the achievement of expected results, learning and integrating lessons learned into management decisions, and reporting on performance. To reinforce a culture of results-based management, a set of practices are recommended: 1) holding managers accountable; 2) empowering managers; 3) focusing on bringing about change in the lives of activity beneficiaries; 4) regularly checking the effectiveness of policies and procedures; 5) establishing a culture of learning; 6) building internal capacities; and 7) sharing and communicating results.",

      "Key Findings": "MIDAS was conceived as an attempt to address and resolve the most critical issues impeding rapid development of the mining industry. Though the MIDAS interventions were and are critically needed, the planned scope was perhaps too ambitious given the project resources committed by USAID and the degree of disorder and dysfunction within MoMP. The opportunity for success was further hampered by the unexpected - though not unforeseeable - commodity price collapse that began during the MIDAS design phase and the inability of GIRoA, despite numerous attempts over the preceding decade, to pass a workable mining law.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Because of the high turnover rates within MoMP, capacity building efforts should be continued. The capacity builders must be specialists within their fields, and must be embedded with their counterparts to provide on-the-job training experiences. The MoMP must be an active partner in designing capacity building interventions. Based upon its historical success and reputation at the MoMP, the U.S. Geological Survey should be the primary agency responsible for capacity building at AGS.",

Although outside the scope of the review, the evaluators still sought to make some preliminary assessments as to what types and levels of effects had been generated by the projects to date.\n\n2.4. Big business in South Africa is currently in a difficult position.",
      "Key Recommendations": " BLSA should engage in awareness raising activities for BAF, especially among government partners. \n BLSA should develop a detailed mission statement, hierarchy of objectives, and strategy for the BAF. \n BAF should consider moving to a more formal selection process, and combine this with efforts to increase awareness (in tandem with clarifying its purpose).\n BLSA should draft a statement or position piece on how BAF fits in within the new BLSA strategy.\n BLSA should make a more conscious effort to engage with the government partner in the conceptualization of projects.

      "Document Title": "Market in crises: the implications for humanitarian action",
      "Key Findings": "The studies showed that there were often unintended and far- reaching consequences from the way in which aid was delivered, because the potential impact on markets\nof how aid was organised had not been adequately considered. These lessons provide powerful arguments that the aid sector needs to make radical changes\nin how it incorporates market awareness into its planning, and how it thinks about the private sector and its role in crises. They also give reason to believe that even more revolutionary change is needed in how humanitarians organise themselves to support food security and livelihoods in crises.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In our three studies, the impacts of a crisis on people’s lives depended in part on how markets were affected. In some cases, markets adapted, to dampen the disturbance; in others, the direct shock was magnified by market perturbations, and spread over a wider geographic area. There was no constant timeframe for the duration of these effects. This suggests that\na problem analysis will be incomplete without a consideration of what has happened, and what is likely to happen, to markets. An immediate snap- shot assessment of market prices and availability may give only a transitory picture, which may cause needs for emergency relief (and for support for recovery) to be missed – or to be assumed wrongly to exist.\nA better understanding of markets could also help identify geographical areas needing assistance, since, as discussed above, these are not always confined to areas directly affected by a shock.\nMarket assessments have proved useful in deciding whether or not a cash or in-kind programme is most appropriate, but the potential of market understanding to contribute to the strategy and planning of assistance has yet to be realised. Livelihood studies the world over have shown beyond doubt that, almost everywhere, markets are the main determinant of most people’s livelihoods.19 It follows, then, that helping to change how markets are functioning may be the most effective way of helping people improve their livelihoods in both the short term and in recovery. In HPG’s three studies, it was found that people’s lives could have been improved by discrete interventions which helped repair market breakdowns caused by loss of demand, loss of liquidity, imperfect information and, in particular, loss of trust within the market system. This research project did not cover all that would be necessary for designing an intervention in the case study situations, but examples of the kinds of interventions that might respond to these needs could include working with financial institutions to supply credit to traders, greater injections of cash to stimulate demand (i.e. rather than aid in-kind), identifying and supporting an institution capable of providing market information, and supporting a chamber of commerce to bring traders together to discuss mutual confidence-building measures. These kinds of interventions are not yet a standard response in either emergency or recovery situations.\nIn two of the case studies, humanitarian aid was itself a source of disturbance to the market, and in the\nthird there was great potential for it to have negative impacts. In Pakistan and Mali, the problem was mainly connected to the distribution of in-kind aid, which compounded the existing fall-off in demand, and by purchasing systems for acquiring that aid. In South Sudan, as discussed above, there were dangers that aid could fuel a war economy, contributing to profiteering by elites who were able to use their position to gain access to foreign exchange at preferential rates.\nThere is a huge appetite within the humanitarian sector for working with the private sector. These studies suggest that this should be approached with far more vigour and at the same time with far more caution than appears to be common. HPG’s studies all showed in particular that the private sector is not, as it is commonly presented, an ‘actor’, but rather an arena of competition for advancing private interests. Market- oriented business activity was carried out by a huge diversity of businesspeople, often with little or nothing in common. The continuation of business activity was certainly necessary for people’s economic wellbeing, but business activity in itself was neither always helpful nor always harmful. The studies showed that aid agencies’ engagement with private businesses to purchase supplies and transport cannot be understood or analysed if the private sector is considered generically or as a single actor. What was important was understanding the identity of the businesses which won or lost from those contracts. Engaging with the private sector may help the recovery of necessary trade and economic activity, or it may feed corruption and a war economy. A more critical approach to thinking about who the market players are would facilitate thinking about the most constructive way to support economic activity, which may lead, for example, to a decision to help local chambers of commerce have their voices heard in the distant capitals where decisions on aid and recovery are made. Starting generically from a desire to ‘work with the private sector’ will not lead to such an analysis.\nBetter understanding of the many different ways in which crises and aid change markets enables agencies to take action before a crisis to help strengthenthe resilience of market systems to crises. This is a developing area of interest for humanitarian agencies, as the recent development of a tool for assessing markets before an expected crisis shows. Since the global financial crisis of 2008 and growing understanding of the likely impacts of climate change, there has been increased interest in the business world in the resilience of companies to crisis, or what is called ‘business continuity’. For the development agenda, the issue is not just about specific companies surviving crises, but also about protecting markets against crises (‘market DRR’). In an area such as Sindh, where floods are regular and frequent (2008, 2010, 2012 and 2015), it would make sense not only to help businesses protect themselves, their stock and their supply options, but also to help the players within a market chain think about how, for instance, they could work as a whole to\nfind an emergency source of credit, how they could be better prepared as a chain to respond to crises and how small businesses could prepare better so as to be able to take advantage of aid contracts. Crises are just coming on to the agenda of market development or ‘making markets work for the poor’, and the analysis which has been undertaken in this field (e.g. Springfield Centre, 2008 and 2015) should, in principle, be relatively straightforward to adapt in making markets work for people prone to crisis.",

      "Key Findings": "1. RCCP developed common definitions, practical methodologies, and tools to help different countries move forward on customized REDD+ issues.\n\n2. At the beginning of the Program, REDD+ was not a well understood task, but it was a priority for RCCP to align REDD+ closely with the policies of those countries in order to reduce deforestation and vulnerability, and create employment by using the REDD+ development pathways following national environmental laws and work plans.\n\n3. There were numerous activities that facilitated the transfer of knowledge and skills to stakeholders at different levels. However, other than the general learning goals for these events expressed in training plans, the Team did not find information regarding how learning is measured.\n\n4. RCCP has played a key role in strengthening capacities and providing technical advice, tools and methodologies. Most of the countries in Central America were not ready for REDD+ when the RCCP began, but they are now working toward this end.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. To enrich REDD+ strategies and restoration strategies, CATIE should finalize and publish the MAS tool.\n\n2. USAID/CAM, in collaboration with CCAD, and possibly with GIZ, should develop a mechanism to exchange information between the USAID bilateral Missions, and also between different projects under different donors involved in similar thematic areas.\n\n3. In future programs, USAID should consider requiring that programs and projects have a training program with clear goals and objectives that go beyond the quantitative performance indicators.\n\n4. Ministries of Environment in the Central American region should continue to update and prepare statements about their readiness in REDD+.",

      "Key Findings": "The exercise estimated total health expenditure in Ethiopia in 2013/14 at 49.6 billion Ethiopian Birr, representing 4.73 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). \n\nOver 86 percent of the spending was on recurrent expenditures (delivery of health services, provision of health commodities and supplies, and operationalization of the health system), 10 percent was on capital formation, and 3 percent on training and research. \n\nWhile Ethiopia’s per capita health expenditure on essential health services is very low compared with peer countries and WHO’s recommendation of US$60 (by year 2015), it has grown significantly over the past two decades, from US$4.5 in 1995/96 to of US$28.65 in 2013/14. \n\nThe share of domestic health financing has increased from 50 percent to 64 percent (30 percent from government, 33 percent from households, and 1 percent from private employers and\nothers) in the same period. \n\nThe share of spending by “the rest of the world” (bilateral and multilateral donors, and private philanthropists) has fallen from 50 percent in 2010/11 to 36 percent in 2013/14.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Increase the magnitude and per capita spending on health with emphasis on domestic financing.\n\nExpand financial protection to reduce the financial burden that health spending imposes on households and to increase health service utilization by citizens.\n\nProvide financial protection for the poor and needy segments of the population.\n\nInstitutionalize health accounts and regular generation of evidence for policy decision making.",

      "Key Findings": "1. When communities need a water source4, have a sense of buy-in/ownership, have access to spare parts and repair services, and the well is reasonably constructed, they are highly motivated to maintain it. \n2. SWSS’s quality assurance processes directed at ensuring construction companies correctly installed wells appear to have been relatively successful, and may be the main source of the\nmodestly better-than-average performance of its wells. \n3. SWSS well performance was also supported by the long-term ongoing work of other actors in the field, including MRRD and DACAAR, particularly with respect to the widespread availability of spare parts and trained pump mechanics.",
      "Key Recommendations": "For implementers of current and future water supply projects:\n1. Document processes and results clearly, to allow for proper follow-up and improve the sector’s capacity to learn from experience.\n2. Previous to constructing any wells, develop a tracking system with clear unambiguous identification codes.\n3. Recognize community strengths5 and use existing community structures and processes where possible, while being cognizant that in some communities, leaders may not represent everyone’s interests or may attempt to capture project benefits for themselves and their families.\n4. Needs assessment should be done routinely as part of water supply construction, learning from best practices already documented by DACAAR.\n5. Community contributions to well construction, especially in the form of labor, should be a requirement. ",

      "Key Findings": "In reviewing the utilization and performance of the current WRS, this study found that Ethiopian smallholders are currently excluded from the benefits of a WRS and WRF by factors such as minimum required lot sizes, illiquid credit supply, debilitating interest rates, lack of (quality) storage infrastructure and financial illiteracy. Private warehouses are not accredited by the exchange to issue WRs and are therefore excluded from the system; public warehouses have been criticized from quality and quantity deterioration; and the Exchange cannot hedge lending against the security of future crop production. If, however, all these systems are included in the same overarching WRS, risk is spread across all actors, transaction costs decline, liquidity increases, and prices become more stable. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Expand the focus of the WRS from exported crops to maize, wheat, tef, and barley.\n2. Conduct a capacity audit of all market actors, followed by a capacity building plan with ongoing training and sensitization at all levels.\n3. Align grade standards for all traded commodities across all sectors, tiers, ACCs.\n4. Create a Storage Investment Plan alongside the ATA's planned National Storage Strategy to first analyze constraints and therefore mobilize investment.\n5. Include all members of all tiers in the WRS management and oversight body/ECEA.\n6. Seek evolution of the national telecommunications provider to include services such as mobile money. ",

Increasing educational exchanges and strengthening workforce development and innovation, particularly in STEM areas, will allow the United States and Mexico, and North America as a whole, to compete in global markets. Thus, FOBESII has the potential to build a more prosperous future for both the United States and Mexico.",
      "Key Recommendations": "We argue that to overcome these challenges, future initiatives must focus on advancing private sector engagement, workforce development, and improving public communication and outreach. FOBESII continues to be a relevant and important initiative, but it is in urgent need of restructuring\nand redirection if it is to make a significant contribution to bilateral affairs and regional competitiveness.",

Many of these partnerships are between USAID and private sector partners (PSPs) working in agriculture. Most partnerships within agriculture value chains aim to (i) graduate smallholder farmers into the commercial sector, (ii) integrate farmers into value chains, (iii) improve farmer skills and productivity, and (iv) increase farmer access to technologies. Effective private partnerships can, therefore, meaningfully improve development outcomes for smallholder farmers while realizing the business interests of PSPs.",

      "Key Findings": "The seed industry in Ghana has been slow to develop since the parastatal Ghana Seed Company was privatized in 1989—in fact, slower than peer countries under similar circumstances.\n\nFertilizer use has historically been low in Ghana, particularly outside of the cocoa subsector.\n\nAn estimated 6,500–7,500 tractors exist in Ghana, but only about half of them are operational.\n\nFarmers and downstream agricultural market system actors have little access to financing in Ghana.\n\nGhana favors the agricultural sector through reduced tax rates and subsidies.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In coordination with the National Board for Small Scale Industries (NBSSI), coordinate to offer business skills training and extension services for smallholder farmers in the Savannah Accelerated Development Authority (SADA) region.\n\nRepeal the new policy that suspends tax exemptions, or at a minimum provide relief for small and medium-sized businesses, until the review of existing exemptions is complete.\n\nConduct a release time study for the Port of Tema.\n\nConduct a checkpoint verification study for agricultural goods along the major trade corridors.\n\nExpand women’s access to justice in commercial disputes.",

      "Key Findings": "In a relatively brief period, EC-LEDS has made great progress in helping countries adopt the tools, skills, and systems that are required to develop LEDS.\n\nEC-LEDS’s work to date is expected to achieve large quantities of emissions reductions as a result of the approaches it has applied.\n\nAssistance to support partner countries’ engagement in international climate mitigation engagement has been effective by building the capacity required to conduct GHG emissions measurement and analysis.\n\nThe WoG approach has worked well in enabling the development of country-level plans to support low emission development planning, in accessing a range of high-level technical assistance from specialized U.S. Government agencies, and in coordinating with EC-LEDS partner countries to prioritize and address needs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Considering the significant progress achieved to develop national LEDS, USAID should reassess the capacity needs of partner countries in key LEDS areas.\n\nContinue to focus on removing barriers to clean energy implementation.\n\nContinue to support the analysis of mitigation options, as needed: each EC-LEDS country should receive continued support in data analysis of GHG inventories, cost-benefit analysis, and marginal abatement cost curves, if required to further define and implement their mitigation priorities.\n\nContinue to manage the program as per the current structure; however, revisit the performance reporting system to standardize performance information reporting across agencies and to focus on assessment of capacity achievements as per core LEDS components and the implementation of LEDS-related mitigation actions.",

      "Key Recommendations": "● Establish regular, face-to-face meetings with the PMU on at least a monthly basis to discuss project implementation, operations, and performance.\n● Increase GIG transparency and information sharing with the PMU including for activity-related spending, activity budgets, funds remaining for activities, implementation constraints and opportunities, and proposed strategies.\n● Develop a sustainability strategy for the remaining implementation period.\n● Develop a learning strategy for the remaining implementation period so that the key counterparts can continue with on their own after GIG ends.\n● Develop the Year 5 work plan through frank and open conversations with the PMU, Steering Committee, and key counterparts.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Improve linkage between Activity IR and Project Results.\n\nMove away from grants for enterprises.\n\nThe PAD Project faces a significant number of important challenges that USAID should address in future projects.\n\nFuture PAD activities should continue to apply a mix of formal and informal mechanisms for collaboration between USAID activities.\n\nUSAID should consider building a long-term component strategy within the CDCS to support local organizations within minority communities to work in concert with the government and other donor programs.",

      "Key Findings": "There are three main principles to keep in mind when engaging with the private sector:\n1) Engaging the private sector on water security is most effective when presented both as a way to address water-related business risks and as a business opportunity.\n2) Industry sectors that have the largest water footprint (apparel, beverage, mining, etc.) have developed water stewardship plans, and can be useful partners and champions when engaging SMEs, who are often suppliers in their industry sector for efforts around water security.\n3) SMEs are often part of bigger value chains, though not always. A two-pronged – top-down and bottom-up – approach, working with MNCs but also with local industry associations, may be the best way to engage SMEs. For both SMEs and MNCs, it is often important to dialogue with neutral brokers (e.g., consulting firms or NGOs) along with local government officials or water managers on basics of water stress, risk and business opportunities.",

The program has successfully established foundations for long-term conservation and demonstrated the conservation approaches that are relevant to conservation needs in the South Sudan. The primary goal of ensuring the survival of the wildlife population has been reasonably realized, but more investments are needed to consolidate these foundations. The program has satisfactorily achieved performance indicators in the Performance Monitoring Report (PMP), with exceptional performance in targets for patrols and aerial surveys. Given the prevailing political and security environment, the progress made by the program is commendable since the factors that hindered better performance were external to the program.",

Government stewardship of the program evolved with the scale-up period, from creating conditions to test product formulations and introduction approaches to integrating chlorhexidine into government and health systems and ultimately financing and procuring the product.",

Know your local context and stakeholders: These relationships and networks can ensure that the design of the prize is relevant. It also allows creation of strong links to the prize participant community, to identify and understand those who will benefit from the winning solutions in these countries.\n2. Cast your net wide and know your pool of participants\nA primary benefit of innovation prizes is their ability to reach many potential new participants with innovative ideas. Understanding which type of solvers you should target and how to incentivise them helps to attract the right attention to a prize and results in workable solutions.\n3. Support applicants and level the playing field: The winning initiatives that are emerging from Ideas to Impact suggest that innovation prizes can stimulate creative solutions. A clear objective, a moderately large but well-defined pool of potential problem solvers and an enabling environment are essential ingredients is still necessary, as is the willingness of participants to bear some of the costs and risks.",

      "Key Recommendations": "To transfer more activities to local prime implementing partners, EDO’s resources should be augmented and some interventions implemented by local prime implementing partners.\n\nTo increase the likelihood of success of interventions implemented by local prime implementing partners in the economic growth sector, a new pre-award assessment tool should be introduced.\n\nRisk management should be improved, and AOR/COR involvement should be frequent and substantive throughout implementation.",

      "Key Recommendations": "USAID should support the MOE to develop a comprehensive plan for institutionalizing the STEM school model, addressing fundamental governance structures and arrangements, both within and outside the ministry, at the central, governorate, and school levels.\n\nIn response to teacher uncertainty and dissatisfaction, the MOE, through PAT, should define the parameters of the career path for STEM teachers, within the provisions of the Special Cadre for Teachers Law, and institutionalize a corresponding professional development system.\n\nUSAID should collaborate with the MOE to explore alternative approaches to partnering with the private sector and the community, based on a mutually beneficial relationship, and draw upon the experience in the US with partnerships between private firms and government entities.\n\nThe MOE should ensure that an efficient and reliable management mechanism is in place, with adequate financial resources for infrastructure, equipment maintenance, and supplies.\n\nUSAID and the Central STEM Unit should expand the mechanisms for strengthening and supporting teachers, within the schools and during the work week, building on the emerging experience with team teaching, coaching and mentoring, and peer support networks.",

      "Document Title": "The Business Case: A study of private sector engagement in humanitarian action",
      "Key Findings": "Collaboration between humanitarian organizations and such companies is recognized as being increasingly essential to address the needs of people affected by humanitarian crises. The private sector in crisis-affected communities is not only severely affected but may also have the greatest impact, especially during the early stages of a humanitarian crisis. A deeper understanding of the quantitative benefits of engagement, including examples of a return on investment to local communities, humanitarian organizations, and companies, would be helpful in advocating for greater principled involvement by companies in humanitarian action around the world. Perhaps the most immediate impact can be achieved through public calls for private sector engagement, and for collaboration by governments and humanitarian organizations.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations to businesses include: \n\n1. Involve the company’s senior management in humanitarian action and partnership strategies.\n2. Identify and understand the business rationale for engaging in humanitarian action. Based on the rationale, decide which partnerships, models of engagement and tools are the most appropriate.\n3. Devise and share custom tools and strategies to tap the potential of partnerships. Select partners according to the rationale for engagement. Define and clearly communicate the business-engagement objective.\n4. Act in accordance with humanitarian principles and international human rights standards.\n5. Monitor, follow up, evaluate and measure the business value of partnerships.\n6. Share measuring tools, techniques and results.\n7. Be transparent about intentions and motivations.\n\nRecommendations to governments include: \n\n1. Incentivize collaboration and understanding of private sector motivations for humanitarian engagement. Set up national-level collective action platforms for collaboration.\n\nRecommendations to the humanitarian community include: \n\n1. Recognize and appreciate rationales and models for engagement by companies.\n2. Enhance and continually evolve partnerships with the private sector.\n3. Include the private sector as a partner in coordinated international humanitarian response.",

      "Key Findings": "With respect to the NRM Project assumptions, the evaluation found them to be inadequate (i.e., they were either not comprehensive and/or there were sufficient gaps in the Project design to render some of them inapplicable).\n\nIn terms of integration and coordination, the evaluation found that each activity contributed to improved stewardship of NRM to varying degrees, often marginal, but there was lack of sufficient\ncoordination and integration efforts to build synergies and ensure that the total contributions of the NRM Project was greater than the sum of its constituent parts.\n\nUSAID’s Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning Program (MELP) for NRM identified four categories of direct threats to biodiversity.\n\nIn terms of governance, the Project primarily focused on supporting Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) as a tool for promoting access and control (or property rights) over resources.\n\nOverall, the WOPE found the current level of private sector engagement, the level of economic benefits, and their distribution insufficient to contribute to poverty alleviation and empower local groups, especially women and youth.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The Project should support a wider range of tools and instruments that increase both property and procedural rights.\n\nThe NRM Project should aim at generating a wider scope of benefits through private and public sector actors beyond economic ones, as well as supporting mechanisms that ensure those benefits accrue at community, household, and individual levels.\n\nSystematic integration of gender variables in the design of all activities, implementation, and monitoring systems is required if gender goals are to be met.\n\nThere is no value added in the portfolio but there should be—the missed opportunity is a major cause of slow progress on NRM in\nTanzania.\n\nThe WOPE has underlined a number of related issues; among them are the inability to scale up evidence and use it for real-time decision-making, lack of sharing of lessons learned and best practices across the project, and inadequate adaptive management for changing context.\n\nA principle of USAID and its Biodiversity Policy is the long-term environmental, financial, and social sustainability and viability of benefits, impacts, and results.",

However, no definitive conclusions on the effectiveness of cash transfer or voucher programmes could be drawn that are universally applicable for humanitarian policy.\nFurther development of the evidence base, with more rigorous evaluations comparing the effectiveness of different cash-based approaches and transfer modalities, as well as approaches to comparing costs and benefits of cash-transfer and voucher programmes, is needed to further strengthen the evidence base.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Despite the widespread use and increasing number of evaluations of cash-based humanitarian assistance, there is a paucity of rigorous evidence about how best to address the needs of crisis-affected populations. This is not surprising, as studies meeting the\nmethodological criteria for inclusion in most systematic reviews are relatively rare in emergency settings. Findings suggests that both cash-based approaches and in-kind food assistance can be\neffective means of increasing household food security among conflict-affected populations and maintaining household food security among food insecure and drought-affected populations; each assistance modality has different advantages and disadvantages that should be considered in the design of future interventions. However, no definitive conclusions on the effectiveness of cash transfer or voucher programmes could be drawn that are universally applicable for humanitarian policy. Further development of the evidence base, with more rigorous evaluations comparing the effectiveness of different cash-based\napproaches (or combinations of approaches) and transfer modalities, as well as standardized approaches to documenting and comparing both costs and benefits of cash-transfer and\nvoucher programmes, is needed to further strengthen the evidence base in this area.

In the overall university rankings, two universities (8.7%) score in the high favorability range, 14 universities (60.9%) score in the medium favorability range, and seven universities (30.4%) score in the low favorability range.\n\n3. The criteria for selection are current capacity on disability inclusion; university (executive level) commitment to disability inclusion; geography; size; opportunity to influence other institutions; and focus on improving accessibility for usability to enhance sustainability.\n\n4. The assistive technology audit revealed needs for equipment/updated equipment. Interviews also brought up the need for training on assistive technology for students, staff, faculty,\nand E-learning professionals.\n\n5. Data gaps exist on the number of students with disabilities (male and female) enrolled.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Capacity building for disability data collection in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) is needed.\n\n2. Support HEIs to develop institutionalized disability frameworks that include (a) a disability policy and (b) a disability support office, with specific processes and procedures for providing disability accommodations to students with disabilities.\n\n3. Support 4-5 public institutions in a comprehensive “whole of institution” approach to improve access to facilities, and services programs for students with physical and sensory disabilities.\n\n4. Support the procurement of assistive technology and training for HEIs.\n\n5. Provide technical assistance to support the GOE (e.g., CAPMAS, National Council for Disability Affairs) and HEIs to collect appropriate statistical and research data.",

      "Key Findings": "PFG’s influence on the USG-GOG bilateral relationship was particularly evident in the partnership’s convening power, the USG provision of research studies and policy documents for decision-making, and PFG’s creative approaches to supporting select GOG institutions and projects through USAID’s Financing Ghanaian Agriculture Project (FinGAP). The lack of new funding streams, however, was an obstacle to PFG’s implementation and success.\n\nAs an addendum to the JCAP, PFG in Ghana developed a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework with quantifiable metrics for all 10 goals, including 22 indicators related to the power sector and 27 indicators related to the credit sector. Per the M&E framework, all TWGs were required to adhere to these metrics to ensure consistency and accuracy in reporting. An integral part of the M&E framework was the semiannual scorecards, which reported progress toward macro-, goal-, and LOA-level indicators. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Establish a clear exit strategy and sustainability plan;\n• Preserve and more fully institutionalize indicator collecting and reporting practices; and\n• Hold a final convening of all USG and GOG personnel actively participating in PFG to enable a final sharing of ideas and experiences and ensure that lessons learned from PFG are not lost.",

      "Key Recommendations": "In outlining plans for strategic transitions, USAID should seek to draw lessons from its own history and that of other bilateral donors.\n\nAmong the most critical factors USAID will need to consider are the length of the timeframe afforded to the transition process—a minimum of three to five years is crucial for guarding development gains—and the need to set clear objectives and tasks as part of a\ntransition strategy.\n\nCoordination has also proven important to the success of past transitions.\n\nWhile USAID should be sure to consider options short of complete exit, as part of any transition planning, the agency will need to evaluate threats to sustaining results achieved with help from past USAID investments and to incorporate plans to mitigate such risks.\n\nFinally, USAID can help ensure its own success—as it looks to reshape partnerships well into the future—by transparently monitoring its transition process and capturing any lessons learned.",

Using a variety of partnership models and approaches allows for a wider range of collaboration and provides a useful testing ground for tackling the complexity inherent in development.\n\n2. Establishing new partnership platforms means longer start-up time and slower expenditures but can reap rewards down the line.\n\n3. Programs falling under DO3 have been effective in meeting program goals and objectives.\n\n4. There is limited evidence that programs and initiatives classified under DO3 are significantly more scalable or sustainable than traditional USAID programs in creating change for the population at the Bottom of the Pyramid.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Partnership Approach: shift to a more focused portfolio of partnerships to reduce USAID management burden and deepen impact.\n\n2. Create intentional opportunities for greater knowledge sharing, virtual, and in-person networking among DO3 implementing partners, and between DO3 platforms and more traditional programs.\n\n3. Both the IPP and the MA are valid mechanisms to test innovative partnership and intervention models and should be continued in future CDCS.",

      "Key Recommendations": "The evaluation recommends an investment in post-care support. \n\nConsideration should be given to supporting implementing partners which have produced good results, and for partners with a presence in the areas where project activities will be implemented.\n\nIn order to reach out to more youth, a working model of using local grassroots structures such as those put in place by the various government departments including Agriculture Extension Officers, Ward Coordinators and Youth Officers could be developed.\n\nThe evaluation further recommends a long project gestation period, more than three years to allow more time for business incubation and placement, considering the challenging economic environment,\nparticularly for internship placements. \n\nEngagement with national and local stakeholders: For ownership and sustainability of the project, there is need for more engagement with relevant government sectors at both national and district levels on the part of implementing partners.

      "Document Title": "Public-private partnerships in fragile states.  Reflection on the practice, challenges and opportunities in Somaliland",
      "Key Findings": "From the foregoing, the resuscitation of the economy and the reconstruction of Somalia will largely depend on the business acumen of the private sector. The existing potential needs to be harnessed and directed towards ensuring business discipline that will not only serve the interests of the people of Somalia but also link them to the international market that they have been delinked from for more than two decades. PPP initiatives have the opportunity to serve show case what joint ventures with the public can result into given the orientation towards profit by the private sector and dedication towards service delivery to the general public that defines the state-citizens relations.\n\nDespite much hype about PPP, it may be necessary for those concerned to interrogate its viability based on potential threats within a given context. The following represent some of the risks that PPPs present: loss of control by the government/public sector, increased costs, political risks, bias in selection process, labor issues and unreliable/ reduced quality or efficiency services.\n\nThe SEED programme generated very important lessons as far as PPP is concerned. The participation of all stakeholders and involvement in decision making is one of the key lessons learnt. During the negotiation process, the inclusion of value chain actors to generate “buy-in” is very important and failure to do this could potentially result in sabotage and boycotts along the value chain which can adversely affect productivity of the facility",
      "Key Recommendations": "The focus on local private sector players could have the benefit of compensating (to a certain extent) for the loss of external investors but more importantly increased local investment which is good for a recovering local economy with potential returns in employment creation and income generation. To this end, the private sector in Somaliland needs to be empowered to respond to demand for better services, guaranteeing quality output, and profitability. The existing social networks purely based on family/clan ties can facilitate such arrangements but this needs to be looked at vis-a-vis the presentation of the same networks as drivers of conflict a situation that projects that more of a \ndividing element in the complex web and layers of conflict in the greater Somalia.\n\nDespite all existing challenges that face PPP interventions in fragile states such as Somalia, greater opportunities exist that could act as a driving force towards strengthening such processes. The idea that PPPs could provide opportunities for investments that in turn creates employment and improve service delivery is a good justification for continued support for such ventures. Nevertheless, efforts towards making the operational environment conducive for business needs to be of prime priority as this will determine increase in the level of investment in the long run.",

      "Key Findings": "Danish foreign aid has moved from a combination of a set of values (human rights, democracy, good governance, sustainable environments, gender equality, etc.) and a concern with the ideas in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (ownership, alignment, harmonisation and mutual accountability) towards a strong focus on short-term Danish non-development interests. The policies increasingly seek to satisfy Danish commercial interests through development cooperation, and choices of partner countries, sectors and multilateral development activities are no longer strongly related to perceived need but rather made on the basis of investment potential, security risk, migration concerns and Danish (often commercial) capacities. The share of aid reaching developing countries is highly fluctuating, as bilateral budgets suffered a great blow between 2015 and 2016 when they were almost halved. Unsurprisingly, aid predictability has been weakened greatly at the hands of shifting priorities, leaving partner countries unable to trust in the persistence and dependability of Danish aid.",

      "Key Findings": "This article explores an initiative located in central Mozambique, the Beira Agricultural Growth Corridor (BAGC). It shows how the international fertiliser company Yara set out to enrol actors at different levels in business, governance and agricultural development into BAGC as a public-private partnership to promote commercial agriculture. Very soon, however, Yara made shifts in its engagement and market strategy, leaving the BAGC initiative to supporting donors and local producers. The analysis presented here shows how the tension between ‘patient-capital’ requirements, high risks and low immediate returns have shaped this case over time – in a context of a national political economy framed by extractive-resource dynamics.",
      "Key Recommendations": "National as well as international public actors need to increase their direct support and commitment to agricultural development – at appropriate scales, and in ways that take local knowledge, local investment priorities and local time horizons seriously. The experiences represented by the remaining actors in the BAGC Catalytic Fund may provide valuable lessons informing such a reorientation.",

      "Key Findings": "The evaluation team suggests the following six lessons learned from WEA:\n Group-based strategies empower women.\n Engaging men effectively in women’s empowerment is essential.\n Technical training for women on agricultural and entrepreneurial skills is a good approach to women’s empowerment.\n Earlier and more reinforced links to government, NGOs and private trader services are essential for the long-term success of women’s IGAs and for women’s full empowerment.\n Women’s VSL groups have significant benefits for women’s empowerment and other development outcomes.\n Private sector partners can significantly contribute to women’ empowerment, but present challenges for development partners because their primary focus is efficient use of human and other resources to ensure profit, rather than long-term investment in the development and empowerment of people and communities. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Integrate some aspects of the WEA approach, with its core element of women’s empowerment in agriculture, in other USAID/Bangladesh FTF programs where applicable.\n\n2. Provide additional, hands-on technical training for WEA women beneficiaries.\n\n3. Consider alternative vocabulary to “women’s empowerment” to reduce resistance.\n\n4. Organize and facilitate additional workshops for women with market actors.\n\n5. Enhance training on accounting systems for VSLs members and start a new VSL cycle.\n\n6. Consolidate WEA gains.",

      "Key Findings": "1. Engaging the private sector to further climate change mitigation and environmental conservation was effective and could be used in other USAID/India programs.\n\n2. Effectively responding to the needs of GOI institutions requires building the capacity in many forestry and climate change topics and addressing the importance of training a wide spectrum of stakeholders within the government (including upper-level, mid-level, and front-line field staff.)\n\n3. USAID programs, especially those intended to build capacity of government counterparts, should factor in the time and human resources necessary to build and maintain strong relationships over\nthe life of the program.\n\n4. The program has shown that promoting long-term carbon sequestration and reduced GHG emissions is possible through an emphasis on capacity building for improved forest management\npractices; awareness campaigns on harmful impacts of deforestation and forest degradation; improved forest and carbon measurement TTMs; community programs with promise as models\nfor scaling; and private sector and donor support for awareness campaigns, forest protection, and restoration.\n\n5. An environmental program can significantly impact the lives of women and men through TTMs that provide them with income generating opportunities.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Interventions that are linked to livelihoods showed great promise and uptake in communities. \n\n2. USAID should plan to conduct a comprehensive training needs assessment with the GOI that includes an assessment of the need for training across sectors, at different levels and for training\nof trainers.\n\n3. USAID should continue to emphasize frequent and repeated communication of project goals, activities, and approaches to GOI counterparts, especially as staff turnover occurs.\n\n4. USAID should consider scaling up and expanding focused, needs assessment-based, capacity building and awareness campaigns at all levels, targets and topics to include, for example, awareness of global carbon markets.\n\n5. Future USAID programs should continue the highly successful practice demonstrated by Forest-PLUS to consider gender when designing activities based on the particular social conditions of the state or community where activities are to be implemented.",

      "Key Findings": "• Between 2014 and 2015, the number of mobile insurance policies issued worldwide increased by 68 percent, to a total of 31 million policies.\n• Only 7 percent of these new policies are in agricultural insurance, so there is tremendous opportunity in the sector.\n• Advances in remote sensing technologies have produced several 30-year time series of rainfall data, enabling government and private insurers to develop and calibrate more accurate predictive models for risk coverage and pricing.\n• In Uganda, the USAID Commodity Production and Marketing (CPM) Activity used mobile technology to collect biographical information on smallholder farmers and connect them to a range of digital financial services, bundling crop insurance and production loans to increase client value.\n• In India, the use of radio frequency identification devices (RFID) comprising a microchip inserted into livestock resulted in fewer fraudulent claims and faster claims processing.\n• The use of a mobile-based loyalty model to offer insurance—where coverage is based on parameters such as increased use of airtime, mobile money transactions, or savings in mobile wallets—has achieved significant scale in certain countries.

      "Key Findings": "Analysis of PBS results and supporting qualitative data from\nbeneficiaries and key stakeholders and review of IP documentation indicates that each of the several overarching goals and outcomes across most of the associated technical sectors were met. \n\nThere were some notable exceptions on the: poverty indicators; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) indicators; and prevalence of underweight women. \n\nAcross the three DFAPs, greater challenges were experienced\nfor activities related to value chain development and other livelihoods/income-generating activities (IGAs), water infrastructure, and latrine building which were also reflected in the midterm evaluations for the projects. \n\nThe water and latrine issues may contribute to the smaller or negligible gains on WASH indicators that were generally observed.\n\nThe use of financial services increased during the project timeframe, but gains were smaller and the overall use of financial services among the populations within the project area was still relatively small at endline.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Overall: Future project design may consider the potential gains associated with an implementation model that aims for fewer activities and more direct beneficiaries per activity within a given community, which may in turn increase the marginal impact per household and likelihood for sustained gains across all households in a community.\n\nMCHN and WASH: FFP should consider replicating and expanding the SBCC model on MCHN interventions that emphasizes gender segregated caregiver/peer educator groups promoting positive health, nutrition, and hygiene outcomes in future DFAPs in Niger.\n\nAgriculture and Livelihoods: The package of CA techniques, improved seed varieties, and effective service delivery models (Farmer Field School, Participatory Varietal Selection) should be closely reviewed for potential scale up in future DFSA design.\n\nResilience: A strategic review of the structural factors impeding progress of the SCAP-RU to work more effectively with commune and regional government authorities should be undertaken by FFP.",

      "Document Title": "Review of Food for Peace Market-Based Emergency Food Assistance Programs: Haiti Case-Study Report",
      "Key Findings": "Haiti is a very low-income country with a degraded ecological setting that faces repeated threats from multiple hazards. It is an excellent example of Food for Peace (FFP) linking emergency and development funding through the Kore Lavi Title II program that serves as a model for the national social protection program. FFP effectively provides multiple and blended food assistance modalities as well as modalities that are sequenced and layered where implementing partners provide a combination of different types of assistance through different modalities, depending on the needs of the Haitian population. This approach has shown to be an effective strategy for addressing both short- and long-term needs to improve resilience trajectories. Families were relocated to evacuation centers and received hot meals even before Hurricane Matthew struck in 2016 in part due to the versatility of Title II 202(e)- enhanced funds. As an example of sequencing, this was followed by cash transfers and essential non-food items for immediate shelter and hygiene through close cooperation between FFP and the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. FFP-funded implementing partners also provided unconditional cash transfers, Cash for Work, and agricultural vouchers in the months following the hurricane to ensure layered programming would meet beneficiaries’ needs. Beneficiaries in Kore Lavi areas also received food voucher programming to meet ongoing food security needs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Continue to invest in enhancing humanitarian and development funded programming, such as Kore Lavi, to ensure long-term solutions, by improving coordination mechanisms (including systematization of monitoring and evaluation across IPs in partnerships).\nIPs should continue to invest in preparedness, especially in a fragile context where natural disasters are expected to continue. Although advancements have been made in establishing supply chains in Haiti, a continued investment in having prepositioned assistance and supply chains for multiple food assistance modalities can help ensure timely response mechanisms.\nEncourage IPs to continue to select modalities that address the needs of the population at the community-level following different types of disasters, based on the local context – including conducting studies on modality options based on the Haitian context.\n Encourage IPs to continue to layer and sequence development and emergency interventions following the onset of a disaster so they meet the changing needs of the population over time. This is particularly needed in Haiti where coherence between various programming needs to continue to invest in improving the resilience trajectories of the population so that people are not worse off after each disaster.\nContinue to partner with government stakeholders to ensure graduation strategies are effectively rolled out, particularity for social protection schemes, including ensuring that donor- government collaboration is consistent among the numerous stakeholders involved in both the humanitarian and development response in Haiti.\nContinue to ensure that emergency transfers are planned to respond to local planting seasons so that assistance is provided during the lean season, for instance (April to early June). This would help farmers to plan around their seasonal calendars to be able to pay for expenses.\nContinue to encourage IPs to work with local community groups (including CBOs and faith- based groups) to ensure programming is community-driven, responsive, accountable to the most vulnerable, and continues to promote long-term partnerships with local groups with programming that reflects the idiosyncrasies of the Haitian socio-political environment and culture.\nContinue to invest in engaging beneficiaries and local community groups and leaders to ensure accountability and prevent fraud, waste, and loss.\n Continue to invest in the capacity of a network of vendors and suppliers to support local markets’ ability to respond to emergencies, especially since local market-based actors are often responsive immediately after disasters in Haiti.\n Continue to invest in improving digital distribution mechanisms through partnerships with the private sector (i.e., mobile service providers) while investing in digital literacy and mobile coverage, particularly in rural areas.\nContinue to promote local food production in program design. In cases where local goods are not available, the use of imported goods to supplement and eventually complement local foods should continue. This approach would continue to take into consideration local food preferences and crop potential.\nContinue to invest in the cash supply chain through continued cash preparedness training of IP staff and ensuring that cash transfer companies and vendors are equipped to handle cash transfers.\nContinue to conduct market assessments prior to emergencies, including at sub-national levels, to prevent delays in implementation immediately after a disaster.",

      "Key Findings": "The case study highlights potential benefits that Humanitarian Organizations could gain in adopting an integrated multi-echelon supply chain. The criteria weights and value functions helped the organization evaluate the pilot and hint at business model insights for agents across the diagnostic supply chain. The most impactful may be the retailers’ emphasis on the time to complete a sale, perhaps suggesting that diagnostics be positioned as a paid service and not as a product sale. Retailers’ emphasis on training indicates interest in providing diagnosis. A paid service could include medical treatment with a positive test result and counseling or referral if negative. The analysis also enabled assessment of hypothetical options based on combinations of products, services, and subsidies. Surprising results indicated that investment in subsidies may not only be wasteful, but perhaps detrimental to private sector adoption. Further studies to validate the results from this single case are essential, but this pilot illustrates how MAVA could improve the productivity of humanitarian funding by avoiding poor investment.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This research indicates that a multi-attribute value analysis (MAVA) might be a promising approach to understand the objectives of agents in multi-echelon supply chains, and particularly may help to engage the private sector in achieving humanitarian outcomes. However, further research is needed to confirm the findings of the case study used in this paper. ",

In the past two years, with assistance from MERP and other development partners, GOU has adopted key laws to stimulate energy efficiency in the housing and utility sector – Law on Ownership in Multi-apartment Residential Buildings; Law on Energy Efficiency of Buildings; Law on Commercial Metering, which requires meters for heat and water, and regulates billing; and Law on Housing and Communal Services.\n\n3. MERP’s assistance in the passage of key energy efficiency legislation (especially, metering, building standards, and HOAs) created a legal and regulatory climate that was much more conducive to commercial and donor investment in Energy Efficiency (EE).\n\n4. The municipalities interviewed rated MERP’s assistance highly.\n\n5. The evaluation found that MERP has successfully helped municipalities take advantage of investment opportunities offered by IFIs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Any future program should replicate and expand the work MERP has begun at the municipal level.\n\n2. Further donor support is needed to develop secondary legislation for recently passed laws on energy efficiency, commercial metering, and housing and communal services.\n\n3. Adopt proven and effective methodologies.\n\n4. Both key informants and focus groups brought up the need to replicate permanent energy advisory groups or “resource centers,” which could be regional, municipal, or HOA-based.\n\n5. Replicate the methodology to help more municipalities attract investments.",

      "Document Title": "Introducing 'for profit' initiatives and actors in humanitarian response",
      "Key Findings": "This review has found that the private sector is already involved in a number of sectors of humanitarian action; examples include the management of specific tasks, the provision of specific services, and the direct management and provision of specific services. The private sector is often involved in innovation processes developing new products and services for affected populations or in the use of new technologies for assessment and data collection.\n\nFor humanitarian organizations, in addition to the urge to improve the efficiency of the response (timeliness and cost), key drivers for partnering with the private sector can include improving processes, enhancing effectiveness and relevance, improving operations, increasing coverage, and ensuring sustainability, as well as flexible financing.\n\nIn summary, while the engagement with the private sector might offer a certain number of advantages, the mindset in which it occurs, however, is a cause for concern. On one hand, it seems that humanitarian organisations, while recognising the need for better capacity and diversified skills in the sector, tend to over-rely on the private sector as a solution. On the other hand, donors’ subcontracting and transfer of risk of humanitarian responses to the private sector play into the underlying dynamics that drive the gap in the emergency response by humanitarian organisations. All this feeds into an ever-growing vicious circle of even more reduced capacity and increased gaps in the response: humanitarian organizations shy away from timely and effective responses and do not invest sufficiently in technical capacities (giving then way and legitimacy for the private sector to intervene). If, on one side, technology does not necessarily equate to meeting needs and ensuring the quality and impact of the response, on the other side the humanitarian sector needs to build its own capacity to innovate and respond to the needs of the most vulnerable.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Given the potential risks mentioned [in the paper], partnerships with the private sector need to be considered carefully. From the humanitarian organisations’ side, respondents have noted ways of mitigating the risks, such as remaining vigilant, identifying services or offers corresponding to actual demands, and avoiding systematic partnerships. A number of possible solutions to be implemented at organisational level have been identified: Dialogue and understanding (to bridge the cultural and values differences); transparency and precise frameworks (to build a common approach, accountability); reciprocal investment in time and resources (to avoid dependence) and third-party facilitation.",

      "Key Recommendations": "● A thought leadership and research agenda should be created and agreed upon within 6 months of program start up instead of creating the plan midway into the program.\n● Programs of this size should have a Consortium Coordinator position to help manage all key stakeholders, and to bring together all key stakeholders (i.e. IPs, donor, ministries) to reaffirm the way forward whenever there are significant changes (i.e. annual plans, key personnel, new partners, cost modification).\n● There is a need for a multi-stakeholder forum where the UN is also involved in program activities to build consensus.\n● Programming should be more holistic, including both education/training and economic activities.

Findings from the FGDs and the KIIs highlighted communities’ strong desire and willingness to sustain project activities.\n\n4. Shae Thot made notable strides to advance gender equality and inclusion of marginalized groups, most effectively through VDCs and VDFs, microfinance structures like WORTH and PGMF, and capacity building and empowerment efforts.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Conduct a needs assessment and situational analysis in each state/region of planned implementation to thoroughly understand the contextual differences among project communities and design activities according to the most pressing community development needs. \n2. Conduct a thorough gender analysis or assessment prior to program implementation to identify the opportunities and entry points to ensure activities in all sectors holistically advance gender\nequality and target restrictive gender norms.\n3. Engage marginalized/vulnerable individuals and groups (including youth, people with disabilities, the illiterate, the very poor), during the program design stage to build early engagement and ensure planned interventions are maximally inclusive.\n4. Clearly articulate the activities within each sector and delineate how consortium partners will share and coordinate responsibilities, if multiple partners are working in the same sector and/or\ngeographic area. \n5. Consider deepening engagement with the government (or relevant non-state actors, like armed groups) at both the national and local levels, as well as with the private sector, to share knowledge and lessons learned, expand the impact of a multi-sectoral integrated approach as early as possible, and identify additional technical and financial resources to support community development activities.",

The contributions in this volume clearly demonstrate increasing institutional focus on\naddressing the fragility challenge. Equally clear is the imperative of working across technical and geographic silos, and of taking risks to address grievances, exclusion, and other underlying drivers of FCV. Looking forward, extreme poverty and the curve of fragility are inextricably linked, progress on the former\ndemands breaking down the latter. For the WBG, this means that achieving the Twin Goals requires doing business differently to help the world’s most marginalized people realize their shared aspiration for a better future. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Expanding the scope of WBG engagement to tackle the drivers of fragility throughout the cycle of conflict and violence, from early intervention through recovery and reconstruction;\n• Strengthening partnerships with humanitarian and development organizations, as well as with local and national authorities and non-traditional stakeholders; • Leveraging geo-enabling and other ICT\ntools for smart supervision of projects in conflict settings;\n• Enhancing our engagement on forced displacement through the IDA18 Refugee Sub-window and the Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) for middle-income countries;\n• Shifting to a culture of prevention and developing an integrated approach\nto prevention;\n• Operationalizing the nexus between peace, security, and development at the country level consistently with Bank’s mandate under its Articles;\n• Placing gender equity at the heart of programming, and doing more to combat gender-based violence; and\n• Enhancing the employee value proposition to attract and retain top\nperformers in FCV settings.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Discuss discrepancies in total market data with all stakeholders and achieve consensus on the total condom market for each sector (public, social marketing, and NGO).\n\nInitiate dialogue with MOH and better coordination among donors to develop specific procurement milestones for MOH for male and female condoms and clarity around donor investment timelines.\n\nCollect more detailed information from social marketing organizations on sales, positioning, geographic coverage, price, and cost-recovery levels for market segmentation analysis.\n\nUse OpenLMIS system to conduct a district-by-district analysis of public sector condom distribution, including frequency of reported stockouts.\n\nUse LMIS data to conduct an analysis of the frequency of condom stockouts by district.\n\nImplement systems to improve requisition and reporting systems for CBOs and NGOs working at the community level.",

      "Key Findings": "1.  At the moment, six of the seven camps in Rwanda have cash and the last camp Mahama is likely to  become cash before the end of the year.\n2. Contrary to expectations, refugees in Rwanda have enough income to be strong potential customers for FSPs.\n3. Using these segments, it is estimated that extending financial services to the refugee population of Rwanda would expand the market for financial services by approximately 44,000 individuals.\n4. Many refugees have used financial services before and want to use them again, perhaps even more urgently than Rwandan nationals.\n5. BFA’s dynamic business case model suggests the refugee population has as much potential to generate profit for FSPs as the traditional Rwandan population.\n6. One of the biggest challenges refugees face in accessing financial services relates to satisfying the ID requirement for ‘know your customer’ (KYC) purposes. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Cross-selling financial products such as a micro insurance product and a loan product has the potential to enhance the profitability of providing a savings or transaction account to a refugee customer. The models presented in this paper show that the profitability of providing financial services to refugees is estimated to be about the same as the profitability of serving the typical low-income Rwandan account holder.",

The ET found that because every water sector activity has downstream consequences, these consequences can impact American national security priorities.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Become more focused when undertaking regional programming.\n\n2. Increased coordination and communication between the regional and bilateral program is imperative, certainly as programs are being designed, and more so when they are set to be implemented.\n\n3. Education, employment, and sustainable livelihoods are critical for youth, who make up large percentages of many MENA countries.",

SBEP was highly effective at opening citizens’ eyes to economic opportunities around them, inspiring them to try new approaches and aim high when it came to what they could accomplish.\n2. Among country partner observers of SBEP in Regional Development Centers and municipal governments, SBEP’s assistance leading to the formation of LAGs across four regions was often considered the most significant change the project introduced. \n3. USAID’s decision to rely on bottom-up suggestions on its project’s economic development priorities was much appreciated by mayors, local economic development office representatives, and municipal private sector representatives, and viewed as right for the country’s stage of economic development.\n4. The scale of SBEP initiatives may not have been large or gained early enough traction to achieve the kind of “critical mass” of awareness and evidence needed to spark their continued growth\nand diffusion within or beyond their regions of demonstration.\n5. SBEP’s influence on regional development trends may become more detectable and significant over time.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. In future large and complex economic growth projects, improve the balance between monitoring for accountability (at the input level) and monitoring to support adaptive management of economic development projects (at the intermediate result and outcome levels).\n2. When selecting performance indicators, carefully examine what they tell the Mission – not only about a particular result but also about the likelihood of achieving higher-level results.\n3. For product-based economic development activities, encourage USAID partners to undertake – while USAID funding is in place - actions that would improve the integration of those products\ninto broader supply chains, including those that reach into international markets on both the import and export sides.\n4. For projects in economic growth and other sectors in which long-term and goal-level success depends on the institutionalization of initiatives in government or their continued existence on a business basis, elevate thinking about sustainability for those which must be self-financing to business plans with milestones that can be monitored and self-sufficiency outcomes to be realized before USAID’s support terminates.",

      "Key Findings": "The humanitarian sector’s evolving understanding of the role of markets in coping and recovery has helped charter a new direction for crisis response. Building on emerging practice, the outlines of an overarching vision come into focus: a response that meets the immediate needs of affected populations while, at the same time, enabling them to take increasing control of their own coping and recovery through local systems and resources. This vision has four interconnected components. The first two components acknowledge the role of existing\napproaches that provide direct support to individuals and households, where needed: 1. Meet basic needs while protecting future productivity 2. Address immediate barriers to individual participation in the local economy\nThe last two components of this vision challenge the aid sector to engage more deeply with the systems individuals rely on most, to increase the durability and reach of our work: 3. Support coping through local market systems 4. Improve market systems over time",
      "Key Recommendations": "There is a need for further evidence to support evolving practice in market-driven crisis response. Key areas for research and learning include: better documentation of how markets and businesses adapt in challenging environments; learning on the role of market-driven programming in sustaining and strengthening social capital; and research on outcomes and the system effects of aid, including a focus beyond direct beneficiaries and program timeframes.\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "Despite the huge improvements in the supported health facilities, one key area that needs to be critically addressed is recurrent stock outs of essential medicines. \n\nThe gains made by MCSP/ RHS need to be sustained through transitioning of health facility staff to the government payroll; ongoing procurement and distribution of IPC supplies; and proper use and maintenance of medical equipment and waste, water, and triage features.",

      "Key Findings": "The results point out that the community feels left behind due to lack of trust in managing the conservation space. Another issue to be addressed is how to improve the democratization of environment management and livelihood base of the local community. Therefore, building confidence and ameliorating relationships between actors within/without the local community should lead to a better Eco-DRR initiative.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The idea of making use of ecosystems for disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) is rapidly growing. The management of mangrove planting along the coastline as a space of contestation was undeniably difficult to avoid. In the study area, it is argued that the restored mangrove forest management\nand newly planted area currently have a limited mandate under the MMAF and cannot function beyond the designated program boundaries. Yet, future initiatives should be scrutinized to ensure they are promoting the actual community needs rather than community acceptance. Promoting actual community needs and considering heterogeneous characteristic of the in situ community may empower and at the same time significantly increase community resilience to coastal hazards. 2. Alternative actors should play a more significant role and be able to improve their capacity to work as partners with the ministry to attain the mandates. Considering such complex landscapes of coastal settings, it is highly probable that stand-alone legislation will likely fail to address the problems. Thus, better management must play a supporting role to carry that burden. 3. In the larger scale, the governance system likely needs to shift its environmental conservation from the centralist state to a decentralized manner, delegating the power to the civil society at the local level. Some scholars have commented on how DRR, conservation, and development are likely to be coupled, as the three activities have a common aim and all focus on attaining goals through market mechanisms. 4. Market mechanism instrument that complements DRR regulations may offer an economically efficient push to socio-environmental protection, encourage sustainable growth,\nand protect resources. For example, community-based payment model may also help limit community\ndiscrimination and promote more comprehensive engagement with outside actors. Therefore, it is an\nurgent need to factor economic incentives to the Eco-DRR activity delicately. It is to avoid a failure that\nwill have a detrimental effect on social concerns such as poverty alleviation in the long run.",

PREPARE will facilitate the execution of memoranda of understanding, letters of commitment or similar agreement mechanisms to provide a collaborative framework and define and link the institutional mandates, functions and responsibilities during a response.\n2. The lessons learned in the Mexico City response will be shared with the USAR groups and the volunteer engineering corps.\n3. In Mexico City, volunteer engineers provided support to USAR teams that responded in collapsed structures. The experience acquired by volunteer engineers in Mexico City will guide the training of the groups in Pasto.",

      "Key Findings": "It is likely that given past and present growth trends, FARMA II’s export and jobs targets will be met at the end of the Activity’s implementation.\n\nWhile there is progress on some indicators, given the Activity’s design and limitations of the baseline survey, it is not possible to say with certainty that FARMA II interventions have produced or will produce these changes in the sales and exports of assisted POs.\n\nGenerally, beneficiaries are satisfied with the TA provided by FARMA II and feel that it meets their business needs.\n\nTo expand their reach, FARMA II’s 2017 approach relies on the multiplication of TA through AgMentor.\n\nThere was satisfaction with the public-sector certification and training received from FARMA II and many stakeholders noted that there was effective communication and collaboration with FARMA II around this TA.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendation 1: The design of FARMA II limited the potential for assessing the impacts of USAID’s long-term and generally well-perceived engagement in the agriculture sector. When designing new agricultural activities, lessons learned from previous programming should be integrated as early as the Request for Proposals (RFP) stage.\n\nRecommendation 2: Given the importance of a combination of TA and grants, FARMA II should prioritize the provision of direct, high-intensity, and high-quality TA to PO grantees.\n\nRecommendation 3: Since new FARMA II beneficiaries will be smaller POs, FARMA II should tailor its TA accordingly.\n\nRecommendation 4: USAID/BiH should reconsider supporting the financing of the two AgMentor physical centers.\n\nRecommendation 5: USAID/BiH should perform a thorough financial analysis to determine whether the AgMentor approach diverted financial resources away from the direct provision of TA by FARMA II personnel to beneficiaries or served as an effective multiplier of TA to the targeted sectors.",

The evaluation team found quantitative and qualitative evidence that KAVES met its objectives related to competitiveness and productivity. Qualitative evidence suggested that KAVES helped farmers increase their income. While not a\nrequirement of Feed the Future, monitoring data on income would have provided clearer quantitative evidence of progress toward this important objective. The evaluation team did not find conclusive\nquantitative or qualitative evidence that the activity achieved its goal of improving food security and nutrition.",
      "Key Recommendations": "POVERTY, NUTRITION AND SCALE\n• Especially for an activity the size of KAVES, USAID should endeavor to measure indicators such as income, poverty and hunger, even if not required by FTF.\n\nMEASURING VALUE CHAINS\n• FTF value chain projects should place more focus on measuring small and medium enterprise (SME) employment development along value chains, as a high proportion of household incomes comes from off-farm activities.\n\nPARTNERSHIPS AND FINANCE\n• USAID should continue efforts to encourage aggregation, as this will bring additional income to smallholders and provide cost-effective raw product supply options for dairies, fruit processors, fresh produce exporters and breweries.\n\nPRODUCTION AND PROCESSING\n• The dairy value chain should be a continued key focus of FTF programming.",

      "Key Findings": "PHS’s quarterly and annual reports show good progress towards many of their defined indicators, but progress towards the larger IRs was not conceptualized or tracked as thoroughly as it should have been.\n\n\nPHS was successful in several areas, including in fostering relationships with the councils, in establishing SQIS protocols, in working with the medical bureaus, in providing OVC support, and in meeting their service delivery targets. \n\nThe program fell behind in lowering the prices of drugs, commodities, and services to the consumer, and in documenting progress or shortcomings towards the IRs across the life of the\nprogram. \n\nThe evaluation team found that PHS had mixed results in achieving the IRs, but the larger picture shows that PHS also struggled with the learning and adaptation needed to be able to manage the competing components as a cohesive program.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• USAID/Uganda should ensure that modifications and changes in scope are undertaken in a manner that does not fundamentally alter the theory of change (TOC) of the program.\n• Implementing Partners (IPs) should periodically pause and reflect on whether their activities and the results being achieved are in sync with their TOC and the program objectives as set out in the\ntask order, including program modifications.\n• IPs should undertake investigations (learning) during implementation intended to establish impediments to achieving results and objectives with intend to support adaptive management and decision-making, and not wait for mid and endline evaluations.\n• A CLA plan should be developed at the beginning of the program and hiring of a CLA specialist should be prioritized to ensure continuous application and integration of CLA approaches.\n• Access to financing for the private health sector requires a phased approach- PHS should first prepare smaller HCBs to better situate themselves as candidates for loans, through interventions\nsuch as HaaB trainings, business skills development, and financial management, before linking the HCBs to the banks. \n• IPs should initiate other modalities to incentivize HFs to deliver comprehensive health services and to add additional services to clients, following the cancellation of use of “performance-based\ngrants” by COP 15 guidance for Program engagement with HIV care and treatment services in the private sector.

      "Key Findings": "This paper shows that: private companies and humanitarian organizations face significant startup costs; local intermediaries play a key role in the inception of a successful partnership;  the most successful partnerships are flexible, supported strongly by senior leadership with clear goals and open communication; private entities must build and have a clear and robust business case for serving refugees.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on these insights, we offer several recommendations to promote the advancement of future partnerships to tackling pressing issues facing the humanitarian system. We propose setting up a global refugee clearinghouse, with an international secretariat and strong regional presence, to help match private companies with compatible humanitarian organizations. Through a small staff and a network of local member organizations, it would help overcome information asymmetries, provide partner due diligence and undertake monitoring, evaluation and learning through rigorous research. More research will thus help increase the awareness of these partnerships and provide insights on how to overcome common barriers. By providing employment and the provision of services, private-humanitarian partnerships offer a novel and promising approach to the global refugee crisis.",

      "Key Findings": "While KIE benefits were intended to flow down to smallholder farmers in areas with the greatest density of poverty to address FTF goals of food security and nutrition, KIE’s measurements of success were inherently contradictory: performance was measured by sales and growth of private sector companies to an impoverished population that had minimal funds, farms with economic potential, sufficient number of animals, access to markets, general education level and intellectual capacity to understand the cost/benefits of how innovators’ products could benefit them.\n\nKIE was neither designed nor implemented to directly address the needs of smallholder farmers; it was designed to identify, foster and bring to scale innovative market-driven solutions and enable innovations to become fully sustainable in the market.\n\nKIE had successful collaboration with two other OEG programs.\n\nThe majority of innovators found the technical assistance to be highly valuable.\n\nKIE may be credited with expediting innovators’ attractiveness to investors through a no-cost capital injection that enabled them to mitigate financial risk while entering challenging geographic markets and experimenting with business expansion without eroding their financial base and company valuations.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Program Objectives, Design and Indicators:\n--Establish a single identity for the project to assist management, staff and USAID to remain on track. \n\nFinancing Criteria:\n--Work with banks to devise loan products that take into account the high-risk nature of innovative agribusiness companies. \n\nUtilize Local Networks\n--Promote project and availability of support through channels as an alternative to donor networks and that will increase reach to women and youth, such as through social networks, agriculture institutes and entrepreneur networks.\n\nMonitoring Progress\n--Establish a process to monitor companies’ financial performance, progress and use of grant funds.\n\nDevelopment Objectives\n--To maximize the adoption of agriculture innovations, emphasize a rural IP presence, ensure protracted farmer contact and employ an aggressive farmer field day schedule.",

At the same time, actors such as private businesses have become increasingly involved in disaster efforts. In this paper, we begin to fill the gap in the cross-sector literature regarding interactions that have systemic impacts by investigating how the simultaneous processes of systemic change and intensifying cross-sector interaction worked and interacted in the context of the preparedness system. We examine these inter-linkages through a qualitative study in the setting of Hurricane Sandy. Drawing from systems theory, we develop a grounded model that provides an explanation for the system change and highlights how cross-sector interaction relates to the changes observed in the system.",

An initial round of interviews with key informants and a review of USAID documents conducted to frame the research revealed there is no clear education sector definition of “education systems” or “systems strengthening”\n2. Evaluations contained limited evidence of systems strengthening. Evaluations in crisis and conflict settings (e.g., South Sudan) noted that weak systems and severe resource limitations severely affected systems strengthening opportunities.\n3. ‘Listening’ to understand the capacity of the system is critical. From the beginning, establishing a forum for dialogue, information-sharing, and decision-making that involves host governments is essential for programming success.\n4. Human capacity development without requisite institutional capacity/strengthening has limited impact.\n5. Mobility of teacher and other education staff impedes human and institutional capacity development.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Develop a collective vision and common strategy for education systems strengthening to follow the Agency’s focus on fostering local institutional and individual capacity-building initiatives that ensure all children and youth are in school and learning. \n2. Review and validate existing and develop additional assessment instruments to evaluate education system challenges and opportunities, with a focus on improving access to education and learning outcomes.\n3. Develop an integrated strategy and approach to support the building of institutional and individual capacity for systems strengthening with a focus on improving access and learning\noutcomes.\n4. Further research is needed on the impact of education workforce recruitment, deployment, migration, and retention on USAID investments in capacity building.\n5. G2G funding in the education sector that targets systems strengthening to support improved access and learning outcomes may require its own retrospective study.",

      "Document Title": " Cost-effective manufacturing in the field",
      "Key Findings": "Our analysis showed that items locally manufactured by Field Ready realise cost savings of up to 90%: Fetoscope: A simple, re-usable medical device The cost of manufacturing is marginally higher than buying an imported item in Kathmandu. However, if it can be produced in the field in remote areas through a fixed or mobile capability, then the overall cost can be lower. Otoscope: A more complex medical device. The cost of manufacturing is 75% lower than the cost of buying an imported item. The item can also be maintained more easily, using locally available parts. Cookstove knobs: Spare part for a high value device. The cost of manufacturing is similar to the cost of buying and shipping replacements from the manufacturer. However, in a situation where the normal supply chain had been completely disrupted a costly delay could be avoided. Vacuum pump part: Spare part for a high value device. The cost of manufacturing is 90% lower than buying replacement parts, which can be difficult or impossible to source through conventional means. Aid agency staff we interviewed indicated that there is demand for locally manufactured relief supplies. However, they also raised concerns that in their experience there is rarely the capacity within local markets to deliver quality items consistently. We also spoke to local and international merchants and, whilst in theory some merchants would lose out if aid agencies bought more items locally, they saw a number of potential benefits. Individual merchants saw potential opportunities to supply new items to their customers, or to deliver value in new ways. To raise interest in supporting the local manufacturing of essential relief supplies, aid agencies and donors suggested to us that there is a need for more evidence to help them to understand how the\napproach can produce value for money over the medium and long term.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It has not been possible in the course of this study to understand the full supply chain costs of the large humanitarian agencies or the Nepali government. Such an exercise could provide extremely valuable insight into when and how local manufacturing can realise radical cost savings in the delivery of aid, and the scale of the potential gains.",

      "Document Title": "Global Public–Private Partnerships and the New Constitutionalism of the Refugee Regime",
      "Key Findings": "Since the early 2000s, regimes and institutions of global governance have undergone a paradigmatic shift in their relations with multinational corporations. The United Nations, in particular, has increasingly embraced big business as ‘partner’ in humanitarian response and development with the establishment of ‘global public private partnerships’ (GP3s). This article situates this emerging mode of global governance within the recent academic discussions on Global Constitutionalism from a critical political economy perspective, focusing on the case of the UN Refugee Agency’s GP3s in refugee protection and assistance. Critically inquiring into GP3s not only as informal global constitutional arrangements but also as a set of political relations, this article asks: what is the constitutional and political nature of UNHCR– business partnerships? What impacts, if any, do they have on the agency? And, what does this mean for understanding global constitutionalism? The article argues that UNHCR partnerships are constituted as asymmetrical political relations in terms of their distributions of power, benefits, risks and commitments, that they are having neoliberal-oriented constitutive effects on the agency and that these constitutional dynamics challenge the more mainstream and liberal-based conceptualisations, analyses and promotion of current global constitutionalism processes.",

This is more than double the project’s top-line indictor of $75M in financing. USAID FinGAP additionally mobilized $91.1 million in alternate financing from the capital markets for two SMEs. USAID FinGAP is widely considered a success, not only due to the number and scale of loans placed, but because it changed the market for agricultural financing in Ghana from one where FIs were reluctant to lend to agribusinesses, to one where FIs are competing for market position in agricultural financing.",

      "Key Findings": "Despite decades of international political emphasis, little is known about the in-country determinants of technology transfer for climate change mitigation. We draw upon the conclusions of a series of standardized, official governmental statements of technology priorities, coupled with questionnaire-based data collection, to shed light on the nature of those determinants. We find that there is a disconnect between what developing country governments perceive as the key enablers of, and barriers to, technology transfer, and what bilateral and multilateral technology transfer programes can offer, given budgetary constraints and the logic of development aid spending. We show that the well established notion of making climate change mitigation actions an integral part of sound development plans is especially relevant for technology transfer. We offer pointers as to how this might be done in practice, in the context of the ‘technology action plans’ developed as part of the United Nations-sponsored technology needs assessment process.",

      "Document Title": "Beyond the Business as Usual Approach: Private Sector Engagement in Post-Conflict Yemen",
      "Key Findings": "Even before the current conflict, private sector development in\nYemen faced many severe and interrelated challenges. These included bureaucratic obstructions, weak infrastructure, a largely unskilled workforce, a poor investment climate and lack of financing, an economy overly dependent on oil, corruption, a weak state, and a rent-seeking elite class with vested interests in stifling reforms. Now, after almost four years of civil war and regional military intervention, Yemen’s economy has been devastated and the formal private sector with it. And yet many formal and informal businesses continue to operate; indeed, the private sector’s resilience is a major reason that the country’s humanitarian crisis – the largest in the world – is not precipitously worse.\n\nIn the event of an end to the conflict, rapid investment and development of the private sector will be necessary to create jobs, rebuild infrastructure, shift the flows of finance away from the war economy and back to formal markets, and to help bring overall socioeconomic stability that will contribute to a durable and long-lasting peace. Preparations for such must thus begin with urgency in order to be ready to seize the window of opportunity that will open immediately after the guns go silent.\n\nWith this in mind, this paper examines other post-conflict developing nations for lessons that can be applied to the Yemeni context. It assesses the factors weighing on private sector development in Yemen over time, including challenges to the business environment and attempted reforms programs. The paper then lays out the impacts of the 2011 uprising in Yemen, the ensuing political crisis and the current conflict on the economy and the private sector. Following this, recommendations are offered to both the Yemeni government and international stakeholders regarding steps that can be taken to revive and develop the private sector post conflict. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Interventions must be conflict-sensitive.\n2. Build local business capacities to implement programs and create jobs.\n3. The agriculture sector should be the target of any early intervention.\n4. Target SMEs and entrepreneurs.\n5. Ensure private sector access to finance.\n6. Yemen’s experienced microfinance institutions should be a key target of all stakeholders for driving more financial inclusion across Yemen.\n7. Reform the business environment.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Recognize a role for the private sector in HIV service delivery—the private sector won’t introduce services unless it sees a\nmarket opportunity, such as high demand or low barriers to entry.\n\n2.

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Establish government partnerships to drive policy level and broader ecosystem changes in WatSan.\n\n2.

      "Key Recommendations": "• Communities should leverage other after school programs for children conducted by other NGOs, but advocate to have them expand to cover literacy and home reading efforts.\n\n• Communities should empower the community Literacy Champions who supported NSVs activities voluntarily.\n\n• USAID, the National Service Secretariat and Ministry of Education should actively seek ways to continue this model in future program designs for USAID efforts as well as NSS/GES direct interventions.\n\n• Parents should continue to visit schools and reading clubs in the communities and keep children actively engaged in reading at home;",

      "Key Findings": "The private sector's participation is essential for a successful implementation of Cash Transfer Programming due to the humanitarian sector's lack of the relevant expertise. The analysis of the results leads to the conclusion that challenges related to collaboration between private and humanitarian sectors stem from the two sectors' perception gaps. Specifically, they are knowledge on finance, governance, structure, market competition, and services offered, as well as humanitarian data protection. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "In closing the paper, we highlight three avenues for future research. We find signs of new donation flows from donors through our interviews. Institutional donors are increasingly willing to contract directly FSPs in CTP because they consider that cash would reach beneficiaries more efficiently. This new trend of donation flows would warrant further research on dynamics between the two sectors as actors is humanitarian response. Secondly, considering that CTP relies on donations collected after a disaster, stakeholders need to consider consequences of liquidity problems. Horizontal cooperation can be observed for in-kind aid by the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD). The applicability evaluation of a horizontal cooperation system to CTP between HOs is worth exploring. Lastly, we\nrecognize that the hawala system transfers money without a legal contract between the entry and the exit points. What kind of information systems should be designed for the informal cash flow from the perspective of vendors and HOs is a promising future research area.",

Further root-cause analysis at the RRHs can help identify possible reasons for the low scores.\n• Provide further technical assistance to the RRHs so that strategic plans can map out improvement plans for poor performance in other functional areas, such as stock management and LMIS record keeping.\n• Ensure JMS has a multiyear operational plan that ties in its partnerships and strategic goals so that the operations contribute to those strategic goals.",

      "Document Title": "Evaluation of Sida’s Global Challenge Funds Lessons From a Decade Long Journey",
      "Document Summary": "This document evaluates  how Challenge Funds are used in private sector development. “Sida has defined a Challenge Fund (CF) as a: “financing mechanism to allocate (donor) funds for specific purposes, using competition among organizations as the lead principle.” Throughout the document 10 Challenge funds are evaluated. The methods for evaluation include: desk review, key informant interviews, and a survey of FMs and fund Grantees. The evaluation found that a more hands on approach to managing the funds led to more success of how the money was used pertaining to sustainable development. Challenge funds have also been able to reach the untapped areas of development that are difficult markets to enter. The document also provides 10 key recommendations that address how Challenge Funds need to provide greater insight throughout implementation. With greater insight, the management  of resources will work to achieve the goals of helping improve poverty impact, gender equality, local ownership, and the environment. \n",
      "Key Findings": "The overall conclusion is that for the majority of the 10 programmes reviewed, CFs have been an appropriate instrument for addressing development objectives and the intended outcomes for the majority of the funds have been broadly achieved. Three funds stand out for their achievement of planned outcomes and impact: AECF, Powering Agriculture and SWFF. The preparation and selection of a CF as the\npreferred instrument was not compelling for Demo Environment, MAVC and Sustainability & Resilience. For these funds, the CF was not considered to be the appropriate instrument of support. \nEnterprise Challenge Funds (ECFs) have proven effective in opening up and reducing the risk of untapped or hard-to-reach markets and in discovering hidden innovation across a wide range of sectors and geographies. CFs are most effective when they address well-articulated challenges where the outcomes are narrowly defined (e.g. Powering Agriculture) or where the project outcomes are broader (e.g. GIF). Sida has been lucky in the relative success of the portfolio, given that an explicit consideration of alternative support instruments was not undertaken as part of their appraisal process. In future, at the appraisal stage, Sida could give more detailed consideration to other aid instruments, before selecting a CF. The preconditions for using a CF are assessed under MEQ3. \nThe experience from the 10 CFs is that in general the more intensively managed funds, with a more hands-on approach, had a greater degree of success in ensuring sustainable development outcomes than the lighter touch funds. CFs which enlist wider stakeholder support, are more likely to deliver impact.\n Experience has also shown that engagement by Sida at all stages of the project cycle is of critical importance, but especially in the design of the fund. This needs to be undertaken collaboratively with the other donors in the case of multi-donor funds.\n The evaluation showed inconsistencies in the understanding of the barriers, challenges and opportunities to address the cross-cutting issues of gender equality, environment, climate change and local ownership. The experience has shown that clarity in the definitions of these terms, as well as an understanding of what objectives might be relevant and achievable is essential. \nWhile the responsibility of project implementation remains with the grantee, the task of the FM is becoming increasingly complex and demanding. There is an expectation that the FM should have a skill set which covers cross cutting issues and a range of skills beyond grant management and due diligence.\n The evaluation also found that regional engagement by Sida in an oversight and influencing role improved not only the outcomes of the CFs, but also the process of local engagement with individual CF projects which in turn offered the opportunity to learn and inform Swedish country development strategies.\nThe evaluation concluded that engagement by Sida in the design, management and learning from Global CFs is essential. From an organisational perspective, Sida’s Global CFs are mainly managed from head office, and greater stakeholder engagement would imply greater deployment of technical Sida staff attached to embassies.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Ten recommendations are set out and divided into short term (immediate), and medium to longer term (1-2 years and beyond). They are focused on actions that can be taken by Sida during its oversight of the implementation of CFs, and at all stages of the project management cycle. \nThe majority of the funds in Sida’s global portfolio are multi-donor CFs and it is essential that Sida is engaged as an equal partner to influence the design of the fund. At the initial appraisal design phase resources should be assigned to prepare an explicit intervention logic or theory of change with clearly articulated outcome and impact statements, consideration of key assumptions, pre-conditions and pathways to\nimpact at scale.\n While not playing a direct implementation role, Sida needs to provide greater oversight of, and engagement in all stages of implementation, including on cross cutting issues. Sida should maintain the power of veto and a no objection basis on project selection. Sida also needs to be involved in the specification of the eligibility and selection criteria. More generally Sida needs to ensure that FMs implement according to the high expectations set for achieving results for poverty impact, gender equality, local ownership and the environment.\nFinally, Sida is now a major player in the design, funding and oversight of CFs. This level of involvement implies the need to institutionalise knowledge and develop a cadre of expertise around CFs. Specifically, programme managers responsible for individual global CFs should have enough time allocated to work on each fund to ensure that they can give them the necessary attention. Sida-only funds, where Sida works in partnership with the FMs, will necessarily require more input from the Sida programme managers than multi-donor funds, where donor oversight is shared between a number of partners.\nSida should therefore undertake a review of the organisational implications for the management of CFs. This will lead to changes in roles and responsibilities which may have a longer term time horizon for full implementation.",

      "Key Recommendations": "To enable integration of MERL with program design, example action items include (1) requesting program staff to work with the MERL team to co-develop the theory of change as well as the subsequent MERL activities and (2) building in sufficient time for the co-\ndevelopment of MERL activities in the program design phase.\n\nTo leverage the MERL competency of leadership and program\nstaff, example action items include (1) assessing their MERL competency and developing solutions for competency gaps and (2) identifying MERL champions who can advocate for investment in MERL competency and the use of MERL for good program management.\n\nTo give equal important to learning activities, example action items include (1) establishing a learning culture by encouraging program staff to share information transparently and (2) thoughtfully designing learning activities during the program design phase.",

      "Key Recommendations": "• To mitigate the difficulties in achieving Mission buy-ins, which stem from lack of time and resources on the part of Missions (and, with respect to some Missions, such as Nepal, a lack of interest), BFS and/or Regional Bureaus could sponsor AA's for Missions with the greatest need for improvement in AET training. Need could be determined by scoping assessments.\n• Project implementers should develop ways to make more direct contacts with AET institutions to promote good AET practices.\n• Project implementers engaged in activities aimed at supporting Missions should take stock of where Feed the Future projects are in the implementation cycle to prioritize resources towards Missions during the project design phase.\n• Future implementers of similar projects should make sure that all assessments address the major gaps and shortfalls of AET institutions, and that they also address Mission priorities and strategies for building AET capacity.\n• Project implementers need to establish public outreach programs that focus on raising the awareness of Mission staff, other Feed the Future projects, and the AET institution community.",

",
      "Key Recommendations": "USAID’s leadership in FP and systems strengthening should\ncontinue.\n\nThere is a need to sustain efforts to reach youth and adolescents with high-quality FP information and services.\n\nIPs should be encouraged to continue to disseminate learning and evidence, both the good and bad (we learn as much from failures as successes), in the spirit of building stronger FP service delivery platforms, national FP programs, and a global CoP.\n\nThe evaluators respect organizational differences in QA as an FP service delivery investment, but believe there should be minimum standards that transcend organizations.\n\nThere is room to improve on organizational models and processes for capacity transfer.",

      "Key Findings": "This study draws attention to four important considerations. The first is the requirement to strengthen standards of WASH service delivery.This is needed because serious failings in the quality of\nimplementation will act as a deterrent for any future management operator. The second concerns the need to rationalize the number of INGOs and UN agencies involved in the post-emergency phase, so that water supply and sanitation services can gradually become viable business models and financially sustainable. The third requirement is to conduct an assessment of the enabling environment (i.e. conditions), which will help to determine the most realistic service delivery model.\nThis will depend on the context. The fourth requirement is to encourage government to set clear policy and strategy directions. This requires mandated institutions (service authorities) to articulate realistic levels of service performance so that business models and financial plans can be established accordingly.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The most common management arrangement observed in the case studies was one of international humanitarian agencies managing large piped water systems in the absence of\neffective government support. In some circumstances, management arrangements included communities managing point water sources themselves. A third option (observed in Ethiopia) was the establishment of a rural water utility to manage large-scale emergency water supply\nsystems. This is a positive approach, but it remains highly vulnerable in the absence of effective government support. A key argument emerging from this study is that emergency WASH systems should be ‘professionalized’ during the transition from emergency to post-emergency\nand the longer term. The main priorities for humanitarian agencies are outlined below.\n• INGOs and UN agencies should try as hard as possible to strengthen standards of WASH service delivery in accordance with the direction of government policy. WASH services\nshould be at least adequate in terms of standards and performance, but if this is not the case then development partners and government need to determine standards for service\nprovision (such as water quantity, quality, reliability, pressure, hours of service and acceptable periods of downtime). In particular, there should be an increased focus on the\nquality of design and implementation and on establishing efficient operations. This will make\nthe handover of WASH assets and services far more attractive to other potential operators.\nExamples of performance indicators are provided in Annex 5.\n• Post-emergency, agencies should collaborate to reduce the number of service providers.\nConstructive dialogue between government, service providers, users and regulators will\ncreate better understanding of the need for a business model approach.\n• Energy to drive change needs to be generated by WASH sector professionals. Senior management should encourage a transition from life-saving activities to the development of\nviable business models and financial plans.\n• Often the enabling environment for establishing professional management models is not adequately assessed. This requires working with government and development partners to\nundertake an assessment of conditions for a range of WASH management options. In emergencies involving refugees or IDPs, this is inextricably linked to applying the CRRF in\npractice.\n• Serious efforts should be made to encourage government (service authorities) to set out\npolicy objectives for emergency response and to set performance targets for the transition\nperiod. This will provide the basis for developing business models and clarifying future financial arrangements. Sustainable WASH management models will be constrained if government does not provide clear and realistic policy guidance (see Annex 6). Business\nmodels should also comply with UNHCR’s WASH design guidelines for establishing more sustainable management systems.\n• If service delivery shifts to a more professionalized approach, grievance and accountability mechanisms also need to be established. Community groups (such as user groups and\nhealth clubs) and water (or WASH) boards can potentially play a useful role in feeding into these systems.\n• Emergency response involves complex and difficult work, and the transition from emergency\nWASH services to a more professionalized management model is unlikely to be a simple\nlinear process. Flexibility and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances will be key.\n• It would be useful to develop a sustainability audit tool for use by the wider WASH sector. The audit tool could be used to guide agencies through a process that looks at the enabling environment and technical, commercial and financial requirements that affect sustainability. It\ncould also be used to guide agencies to set realistic and acceptable levels of performance for WASH service provision.",

      "Document Title": "Market Systems Resilience: A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASUREMENT",
      "Key Findings": "The structural and behavioral characteristics of market systems highlights key lessons for defining market system resilience capacities.\n- Market systems are structurally complex with many interconnections, making it difficult or impossible to isolate changes in markets from political, cultural, natural resource, and other systems or changes at the governmental level from the household level.\n\n- Interconnections tend to amplify feedback resulting from shocks and stresses.\n- System-level resilience is different from the resilience of individuals, households, or communities. Systems thinking makes clear that the emergent patterns we see in market systems are the result of a complex and dynamic network of interactions among individuals, households, communities, value chains, other interconnected systems, and so on. These interactions include feedback loops filtered through systemic biases or mental models, which in turn shape how systems respond to stimuli, such as shocks and stresses. What this means is that the complexity of the interactions, the synergies among them, and the embedded biases of the different actors make systems different from simply an amalgamation of all the parts of the system. Thus, in the short terms, individual market actors may thrive at the expense of the wider community or market-system resilience. Conversely, actors may fail but the system could become stronger.\n- Understanding system biases (i.e. slow-moving variables) can be critical to achieving longer term resilience and transformative change. Fast-moving variables should not be ignored but rather understood for what they are (i.e. while they can change quickly  they can also change back quickly without meaningful change in the system).\n- Market systems are dynamic and constantly evolving. Thus—in those contexts where the system is producing outcomes that are less than ideal for individuals, households, and communities — the objective for practitioners should be to catalyze a shift in the orientation and direction of the market system that aligns with better outcomes, including improved resilience capacities. This approach is different than aiming to enhance resilience solely through singular, technical improvements, such as commercial restocking or sand dams. Rather the focus for practitioners offered here is on improving how the system allocates and marshals resources in the face of shocks and stresses.\n- Facilitation needs to guide market systems in a direction that enables individuals, communities, and systems to solve their own problems and allocate resources—through market mechanisms—to better absorb, adapt, and transform in the face of shocks and stresses over the long run.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Since market systems have to be understood in context, and the pathway towards inclusivity is neither uniform nor unidirectional, we advise that market systems are only benchmarked against their previous scores for the same system, but not against other systems or idealized (normative) notions of what constitutes an optimum level of proactive-reactive orientation. The tool is designed to measure the direction of change as well as the relative change from one time period to the next (e.g., from baseline to a chosen mid-line). Measure of change in system resilience is relative rather than absolute, which is conceptually almost impossible to measure since systems evolve and the boundaries of what constitutes absolute reactive or proactive risk management in practice is fluid.",

      "Key Recommendations": "USAID should offer more programming like ABADE; productive enterprises have a huge need for M/E and such an initiative can produce real, sustainable jobs.\n\nIf precise indicator data, e.g., “jobs created,” are not available, suitable proxies should be used together with regular on-site observations, while keeping in mind limitations on data validity.\n\nM/E vendors should provide not only M/E according to specifications, but also technicians to help install and integrate the M/E into existing production lines, and train on operation and maintenance.",

      "Key Findings": "We roughly estimate that around 5 per cent of humanitarian agency expenditure is dedicated to oil fuel and oil-fuelled generation – a share equivalent to $1.2 billion in 2017. The overall picture of energy use by humanitarian agencies is one of inefficiency and therefore wastefulness.This stands in contrast to the overall ambitions of the sector to do no harm, in terms both of global climate and local environment. The will to change is there, and several large agencies\nhave made significant progress, but greater focus and resources are needed to make step changes in the way things are done and to bring the sector into line with the UN system’s\ncommitment to carbon neutrality.\nThe examples of good practice described in this paper show that it is possible to do things better,\nand in many cases to save valuable funds that could be diverted to core humanitarian ends. Drawing on the examples in this research paper, we estimate that achievable changes in practice and\ntechnology could reap the sector some half a billion US dollars in operational cost savings each year.\nThe solutions variously require capital, better data, governance reforms, new skills,\npartnerships with private firms and other entities, or changes in human behaviour. Implementing\nthese changes will entail both top-down and bottom-up action.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Require humanitarian agencies to provide a breakdown of their energy cost projections in budgets, backed up with assumptions about consumption and costs. Ask about fuel rationalization and energy strategies in talks with humanitarian agencies, and request updates on progress. Offer support to projects that unlock system change, and that enable models that can be adapted for replication. Consider contributing to a multi-country fund to de-risk the larger investments to transform large displacement operations. Ask humanitarian agencies what steps they are taking to reduce their emissions and impact on host-country resources. Where possible, include sustainable energy as a priority area in humanitarian response plans\n(HRPs) and encourage aid in energy projects that will leave a positive legacy in-country. Where possible, include sustainable energy as a priority area in humanitarian response plans\n(HRPs) and encourage aid in energy projects that will leave a positive legacy in-country. In cases of prolonged displacement/humanitarian presence, consider enabling infrastructure\ninvestments that will reduce energy and water demand in camps and harness local market expertise. Consider partnerships with humanitarian agencies operating in remote locations to improve energy access for rural areas.",

      "Key Findings": "Evidence suggests that most incubators and accelerators (26 of\n29 interviewed) benefited from SEBI’s capacity building measures\nand networking activities.\n\nThe evaluation found that, at macro level, after six years of SEBI, there is still no legislative framework in place in Jamaica to support SEs and significant questions remain as to what that framework should look like and include.\n\nSEBI pursued a range of awareness raising activities (e.g., workshops, trade fairs, and media campaigns, such as the “Buy Social” social media campaign), which brought the concept of social entrepreneurship to a previously unreached audience (youth, women, government, and private sector players) in Kingston and St.\nAndrew.\n\nThe evaluation found no broad- based awareness of SEJA among project beneficiaries (direct or indirect) or stakeholders from KIIs\nand FGDs, in terms of its suggested purpose, structure, or business model.",
      "Key Recommendations": "For any current or future similar projects, the ET strongly suggests\nthat a specific needs analysis should be conducted to identify the unique needs and challenges for each SE for targeted interventions to be developed and implemented at the pre-project design stage.\n\nTo build on the progress achieved so far, the ET recommends that any future similar projects incorporate SEBI’s enabling environment\nobjectives to ensure that social entrepreneurship remains on the\nradar in Jamaica.\n\nFor future interventions supporting SEs, special effort must be made to include local stakeholders in the rural parishes, including hosting awareness events there.\n\nBefore any such entity is contemplated all stakeholders must be consulted, including at local level in the parishes, in order to ensure that such a body is viable and sustainable and that it is aligned with the actual needs and requirements of intended beneficiaries.",

      "Document Title": "Demonstrating a Market Systems Approach in",
      "Key Findings": "This report synthesises the successes, challenges and additional considerations brought forth from the pilot and provides key recommendations based on the lessons learned to assist the donor, implementing organisations and the community in understanding and adapting programming to a more market-based and a sustainable alternative to direct aid. The report is organised around several themes which emerged through the evaluation, which speak to both the challenges and opportunities in the region, as well as with using a market-based model to humanitarian assistance, with the key findings highlighted as follows. 1.The pilot demonstrated mixed evidence regarding increased agricultural income but signs of increased market engagement. 2.The pilot incentivised host community farmers to give land to refugee farmers by offering free tillage services on one acre of their land for every five acres given to refugee farmers.3. The pilot raised awareness of improved seed\nvarieties and supported increased uptake of improved varieties. 4. Pilot farmers cited improved access to inputs, including improved seeds. 5. The pilot strengthened relationships between seed companies and agro-dealers, inspired agro-dealers to engage in more marketing activities an illustrated market opportunity to agro-dealers. 6. The pilot’s partial subsidies were an effective incentive to increase uptake of improved seeds and land preparation services among farmers, though willingness to pay market price for such products and\nservices was unclear. 7. Changed behaviours were positive indications of early market systems changes. 8. Improving market opportunities requires a multiyear approach. 9. The pilot highlighted gaps in understanding of market dynamics and sales channels with greatest\npotential for farmers in West Nile. Additionally, Pilot farmers showed a significant reliance on informal\nsources for market information. 10. The pilot clearly demonstrated the need for future programming to address cross-cutting constraints\nsuch as access to finance, climate change and transport issues related to poor infrastructure.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "However, learnings from the pilot clearly indicated that price remained a primary barrier for farmer uptake of improved inputs and tillage\nservices. In fact, limited access to capital as well as appropriate financing schemes were seen as key constraints to growth of the agribusiness sector by all market actors. Over half of farmers cited lack of credit as a key impediment to the success of their agricultural activities. While access to finance goes beyond the scope of project activities, further research and investment is required in this area. While the pilot captured a significant amount of valuable market information over the 12-month pilot, gaps in understanding remain related to market potential as well as the most viable and profitable sales channels for West Nile farmers. Furthermore, only time will evidence the true cost benefit to farmers in using improved inputs and services. Capturing this information over multiple years to build the business case for farming could be a powerful tool to engage farmers and leverage buy-in from agro-dealers, seed companies and offtakers, as well as external actors such as government and donors. Whilst the above highlights how marketsystems development is a multi-year process, there are also key areas where the donor and NGO community as a whole can start to affect immediate changes to support more market-driven approaches to programming long-term. In the shorter-term, NGOs and programmes can facilitate linkages between farmers and market actors to build trust, reduce information asymmetries and fulfil a middleman role in supporting increased accessibility of products and services. Focus can also be placed on helping farmers access information to determine if investments to increase production can increase farmers’ incomes, while supporting them to overcome key constraints to make the transition to commercial agriculture (access to land for refugees, inputs, services and market opportunities). More strategically, NGOs can look internally at how to remove themselves from the supply-chain, and instead, work with and through appropriate market actors. For instance, NGOs can work more closely with private sector market actors to take ownership to deliver activities like training, marketing\nand awareness raising, as well as utilising private sector actors to procure inputs and services. The focus of NGOS can, in turn, be to build the capacity of these market actors to deliver agricultural services, identify\ncommercial models with potential for scale and encourage other actors to enter the market, thereby expanding and growing the agribusiness sector.\nIn the longer-term, there is need and potential in the region to support a larger-scale, multi-year approach to\nprogrammes supporting sustainable growth of the agribusiness sector and agricultural incomes. Such an\napproach would embed a wider range of cross-cutting themes, such as climate change and access to finance, and allow more time and resources to be allocated to better understanding market dynamics (such as local,\ninformal sales channels that may offer better prices than offtake companies), better align the expectations of farmers and offtakers, and build an understanding of the most feasible and profitable sales channels for\nfarmers. A multi-year engagement would also allow for an increased focus on addressing infrastructural\nchallenges such as aggregation, transportation and distribution, all of which require long-term investment and buy-in. Most importantly, this would allow farmers to make the transition from subsistence to commercial farming in a way that slowly reduces reliance on NGOs and subsidies over time, allowing farmers (and all actors along the value chain) time to invest sustainably, gain the skills and experience required to be successful, and increase their incomes with the ultimate goal of long-term self-reliance rather than direct assistance.\n ",

      "Document Title": "Food Systems at Risk: New Trends and Challenges",
      "Key Findings": "The first section provides the framework of what comprises a food system, its drivers and outcomes, and how the main drivers have changed in past decades and are expected to change in coming years. There are\nmultiple ways for dealing with the modelling/representation of food systems and our choice was based on our own experience and on the latest scientific literature and studies by international organisations. Our choice was also motivated by the need to assess, in the future, food systems on a local basis, where many political decisions will have to be designed and implemented.\nSection 2 deals with the interactions between food systems and climate change. It concerns both the contribution of existing food systems to climate change (their carbon footprint, the specific contribution of the increase in animal production and deforestation), and one specific consequence of climate change on food systems, with a chapter dedicated to the emergence of new pests and diseases.\nSection 3 deals with the environmental consequences of existing food systems: over-exploitation of natural resources, irreversible biodiversity loss and pollution of water, air and soil. It also assesses the possible feedback effects of these degradations of natural resources on food systems.\nSection 4 considers the social and economic dimensions of food systems. It reviews the implications of current trends for job creation, for the inclusion of small-scale actors, women, minorities and territories into food systems, and the implications of modern digital technologies. It shows that while food systems could be a major building block for prosperity and stability in many LI and LMI countries, current trends are threatening the\nability of countries to meet this potential. There are inequalities between actors within food systems, including women and minorities, between territories, there are difficulties in making labour-intensive food systems a\npriority and there is a high risk of excluding many stakeholders from the benefits of digital technology, which may trigger further civil conflicts and food crises.\nFinally, Section 5 concerns food and nutrition security, an outcome determined by two other food system outcomes (environmental and social and economic). It deals first with the difficult question of food production which is sufficient to meet needs, then two chapters are devoted to the question of the international market for food products and its price instability. Finally, the last two chapters address the negative effects of changing diets on health and the increase in safety risks.",
      "Key Recommendations": " Based on this analysis, this food system diagnosis framework must meet a set of indispensable requirements: it must be systemic (and not value chain centred) to embrace the locally specific features and combination of risks food systems face; applicable at different scales depending on inner features of food systems; dynamic to unravel past evolutions and imagine future scenarios and their main drivers; and operational to identify the potential policies, projects and programmes – and the critical stakeholders – which could radically transform food systems in the future. Such a diagnosis framework does not yet exist, but is urgently needed.",

      "Document Title": "Outsourcing of humanitarian logistics to commercial logistics service providers",
      "Key Findings": "The findings of this study can be summarized in four propositions. The first proposition reflects how the disaster phases affect the outsourcing decision and relates to our three\nresearch questions. We found that incentives (Why) for initiating outsourcing engagements,\nselection criteria of providers (How) and activities to be outsourced differ between the three disaster phases (What). This has an impact on the perspectives that HOs and LSPs have of the process of outsourcing, because of the different characteristics of humanitarian\noperations and needs in the different phases, for instance differences with respect to urgency of response, uncertainty of the environment and available resources (Kovács and Spens, 2007): P1. The outsourcing process of humanitarian logistics is highly affected by the disaster phases. It differs with respect to incentives to initiate outsourcing, partner selection criteria and activities to be outsourced. P2. HOs lack a strategic perspective concerning how they initiate and execute outsourcing.\nMany HOs are mainly adopting an ad hoc/short-term outsourcing perspective due to donor requirements and the uncertainty of humanitarian operations. P3. Many HOs lack a specific outsourcing policy. Further steps should be taken to analyze the logistics systems and set up a policy for activities to be outsourced throughout the\ndisaster phases. The establishment of a set of selection criteria of LSPs is necessary. P4. HOs can play an  mportant role in development and capacity building of local logistics\nproviders. Hence, careful selection of and interaction with providers is necessary.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Future research needs to investigate outsourcing in small HOs. Alliances of HOs may be an option as many interviewees said that they are interested in collaborating with other HOs in their effort to establish partnerships with the private sector. They believe that alliances of HOs are attractive to the private sector and can guarantee better prices. A second area for further research relates to the selection and evaluation of partners. Our results indicate that many HOs lack a systematic list of criteria when they are selecting LSPs. Future research is needed for the development of a comprehensive framework for\nthe selection of logistics providers for HOs. In addition, HOs lack measurements to evaluate the performance of LSPs. Case studies which investigate the performance of existing outsourcing relationships are needed to develop metrics. A third area for future research relates to the role of LSPs in humanitarian operations. We investigated the willingness of LSPs to cooperate horizontally or in clusters with other commercial logistics providers in order to directly offer relief services to beneficiaries. The\nmajority of organizations are interested in horizontal cooperation and “see the potential in direct cooperation and collaboration, but it will take a long time.” It is worth investigating,\nhow LSPs can collaborate to offer profit-based services to HOs. In addition, since donors are increasingly willing to contract the private sector directly for the execution of\nhumanitarian programs like cash transfers (ECHO, 2017), future research is needed that explores this partnership. Finally, further research is needed with respect to the coordination mechanism of\noutsourcing especially with a focus on contracts between the two sectors. Further research needs to propose a framework that will help organizations to decide the parameters to put in\nplace to standardize contracts with LSPs. Choosing the right contract design and pricing policy plays a very important role in facilitating successful outsourcing partnerships.\nFuture research should develop analytical models that explore which types of contracts and pricing policies are appropriate for which types of situation. Game-theoretic models seem especially suited to address the underlying trade-offs.",

      "Key Findings": "The findings shed light on some implications for practitioners to successfully promote and implement PPP projects. First, the cases emphasize the importance of having open and effective management practices to promote the success of PPP projects. Second, the creation of new independent agencies may help run the PPP projects smoothly, which, in turn, can lead to greater efficiency and flexibility. Finally, PPPs require support from not only local governments or private operators but also from local citizens and other community organizations. Overall, effective leadership is what ties all these factors together. ",

      "Key Findings": "Throughout 2019, the SCC has placed increasing importance on more frequent structured engagements for members. This includes quarterly, in-person member meetings in Kenya and Uganda and regular, thematic “Pillar Calls”, allowing for opportunities to identify and strengthen collaborations and enable deep technical learning. These engagements have fostered new bilateral collaborations between members who highlight the role of SCC in creating these linkages.",
      "Key Recommendations": "On World Refugee Day, the SCC published a blog that outlined our approach to date: narrow the scope; understand needs, identify gaps; implement. In order to make good on the promise that the SCC can facilitate effective collaboration among the public and private sectors to improve the delivery of vital services and enable better outcomes for the forcibly displaced and their host communities, 2020 must be the year of implementation. We are counting on you to poke and prod us to stay resolutely focused on action, and we will count on you to act. Together we can show that change – in the way we work, in the way we address needs, in the way we measure success – is possible.",

      "Document Title": "Enabling Private Sector Engagement in Disaster Resilience in South and East Asia",
      "Key Findings": "Businesses are closely related with communities not only as providers of goods but also as job market creators. The timely and efficient recovery of business operations is crucial for serving the basic needs of disaster‐stricken communities and the continuation of daily life activities, thus speeding up the return to “normalcy.” The majority of private business is still unaware of the possibilities, opportunities, and advantages of engaging in disaster risk reduction (DRR)‐related initiatives. The current paper argues that information sharing, access to funding, adequate and easy‐to‐understand and to follow rules and regulations, and functioning public institutions with designated coordinating bodies need to be in place to enable this process. This study concludes that coordinated, tailored, continuous efforts by both businesses and the public sector, supported by international organizations, will be needed to tackle the complex web of disaster challenges now and in the decades to follow. The paper will focus on East and South Asia as some of the most disaster‐prone regions in the world, without comparing the success rate between the individual countries. It is, instead, intended as a perspective paper, aiming to provide a broad regional overview of some of the challenges and opportunities in engaging the private sector in disaster management, and to present some high‐level policy suggestions on how to better address the existing issues.",
      "Key Recommendations": "For any government to be able to coordinate and engage private sector effectively there is a need for a clear vision and strategy with defined goals and assessment metrics. The government should be able to identify public and private stakeholders who an share leadership and pinpoint common issues among partners an suggest possibilities for common projects to tackle those issues.

For this reason, companies tend to consider them as marketing tools instead of striving to develop and implement\nsuch programs on a larger scale.",

      "Key Findings": "Although multinational operations have the potential to benefit communities in the Pacific, they can also disrupt local values and principles and lead to more individualized practices, ultimately having negative impacts on community well-being. This article illustrates two specific cases of this, highlighting the disjunctures between indigenous perceptions of the good life in Fiji and Papua New Guinea and experiences of “development” associated with large-scale mining and tourism operations. Yet the gap between the aspirations for community well-being and development and their fulfillment is also the space where opportunities exist to advance meaningful forms of development.",
      "Key Recommendations": "We believe that if multinational companies genuinely seek to support locally meaningful forms of human development, they must find points of connection with indigenous values of well-being and development.\n\nWe argue that recognizing the value of the collective good to indigenous communities must be a key component of any form of community development intervention.",

      "Document Title": "Public Private Partnerships Review of Kazakhstan",
      "Key Findings": "Kazakhstan has put in place a well-structured legal and institutional framework for preparing Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) at both the national and regional levels. The government has prioritised PPPs as a delivery mode for both economic and social infrastructure. The central emphasis on PPPs had a strong impact at the regional level with a large number of relatively small projects signed in the past years. At the national level the impact has been modest mostly due to financing challenges. In terms of priority areas for reform, the report outlines capacity building (particularly during the project preparation phase), the need to promote quality over quantity of PPPs, strengthening the methods used to guide the choice of delivery mode, and transparency and accounting of contingent liabilities",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Strengthen central government support for PPP preparation and monitoring at the regional level.\n2. Ensure coherence between the PPP Law and other relevant legislation.\n3. Adopt sector standards for PPPs.\n4. Reform the domestic financial system so that it becomes a more effective partner for infrastructure development.\n5. Demonstrate long-term commitment to private financing.\n6. Ensure project documentation matches international standards.\n7. Leverage public resources to mobilise private financing. \n8. Strengthen partnerships with MDBs.\n9. Develop a clear policy and limits on guarantees for PPPs.\n10. Strengthen central government support for PPP preparation and monitoring at the regional level.\n11. Maintain the rigour of the current gateway process while simplifying the analytical requirements for smaller projects\n12. Develop clear guidance and transparent criteria for prioritising all infrastructure projects, including PPPs and concessions\n13. Develop clear guidance and transparent criteria for prioritising all infrastructure projects, including PPPs and concessions.\n14. Ensure that the choice of delivery mode is grounded in value for money analysis rather than budget expediency.\n15. Expand data collection on PPPs.\n16. Assign responsibilities and allocate resources for conducting independent ex post evaluations.\n17. Kazakhstan could improve transparency of PPP procurement process.\n18. Kazakhstan could develop additional tools to improve the way PPPs are treated in the budget process.",

In 2019 again, the results were encouraging across all areas, indicating that CBi is valued by its key stakeholders and provides much-needed humanitarian support.\n\n- 100% believe that CBi is positively influencing its Member Networks’ efforts to address disaster management (73% strongly influenced, 27% moderately influenced)\n- 80% believe that CBi helps them connect and coordinate well or very well with actors in disaster management.\n- Over 80% of the Member Networks find that CBi is very successful at providing opportunities for peer-to-peer learning.\n- Over 90% of the Member Networks said CBi successfully raised awareness of and advocated for the role of the private sector in disaster management.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Moving towards more resilient and sustainable approaches requires CBi and its partners to increasingly consider: strengthening local actors to implement disaster management; addressing climate change-related hazards; leveraging innovation and new technologies; using predictive analytics and anticipatory approaches to better prepare for crises; shifting towards prevention and addressing root causes, particularly in the context of manmade disasters; ensuring that no one is left behind, including women who are often more adversely affected by disasters.

      "Key Findings": "Public‐private partnerships (PPPs) in public health have gained great attention in the global health literature over the last two decades. Evidence suggests that PPPs could contribute to mitigating complex health problems. There is, however, limited knowledge about the process and specific conditions in which PPPs for healthy eating, in particular, can be developed successfully. To address this gap, this article first summarizes the literature, and second, using qualitative content analysis, identifies factors deemed to influence the process of building PPPs for healthy eating. The literature search was undertaken in two stages. The first stage focused on PPPs in public health to understand what constitutes a PPP, and the types and characteristics of PPPs. The second stage sought empirical examples and conceptual papers related to PPPs for healthy eating to identify critical elements that could facilitate or hinder partnerships between the government and the food industry. The search yielded 38 articles on PPPs in public health and 20 on PPPs for healthy eating. The analysis generated 23 individual elements that have the potential to influence a successful process of building PPPs for healthy eating (eg, endorsement from an individual champion, equal representation from partner organizations on board committees). The analysis also yielded five factors that appeared to well represent the 23 individual elements of PPP formation: motivation, enablers, governance, benefits, and barriers. These results constitute an important step to understand critical factors involved in the formation of PPPs in public health and should inform additional empirical research to validate them.",

      "Key Findings": "Along with the new challenges in the process of adapting to the market economy, targeting the demand and supply law, the competition law and the process of Romania's integration into the European Union, the rehabilitation of transport infrastructure, water supply, waste recycling, environmental protection, monitoring state aids, ensuring a loyal and predictable business environment, are the main reasons for using public-private partnership as a way of working together between the public sector, the initiator of public utility projects and the private sector, the fund holder and the executive management. Increasing the availability of the private sector to take on a range of responsibilities and risks as well as the public sector to privatize public utility services has resulted in the multiplication of efforts to introduce the concept of public-private partnership to achieve economic and social objectives and projects from Romania. Over time, the concept of public-private partnership has been the subject of legislative regulations both in the Member States of the European Union and in Romania, which recently adopted a new normative act on this type of partnership and which constitutes a objective of the Governance Program over the period 2018-2020 on the objectives of economic growth and strengthening fiscal-budgetary sustainability by significantly increasing the budget-financed investments or by accelerating the absorption of the European funds and by stimulating private investment. In view of the above-mentioned aspects, we propose that through this paper we address the theoretical issues of the public-private partnership and from the investigations carried out to highlight the advantages and the limits of a partnership of this kind, but also the main categories of institutions that are most effective in realizing of such partnerships with major benefits for the entire national economy.",

      "Key Findings": "The gender analysis revealed that USAID implementing partners (IPs) and other stakeholders in Bangladesh are grappling with how to best engage women under a private sector-driven approach.\nDifferent strategies are being applied, some of which show promise. Certain actors are targeting women through traditional value chains (VCs) and roles, while others are looking for new opportunities. Long- term sensitization programs around shared decision-making and control over assets have made a household approach viable, while supporting strong female entrepreneurs is helping women access larger and nontraditional sectors.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Gender mainstreaming in the DO 2 portfolio: IPs should remain open to a variety of potential pathways to achieve women’s\neconomic empowerment that are designed around gender-sensitive analyses carried out during the start-up phase, and that are regularly updated to capture and respond to any changes that take place as a result of activity interventions or other external factors.\n\nEnabling environment: IPs can work through local stakeholders to raise awareness of and access to any government subsidies and other benefits targeted at female farmers/entrepreneurs.\n\nValue chain roles: To enable female producers to learn good agricultural practices and access inputs and information, IPs should continue to apply the local service provider (LSP) model.\n\nAccess to resources and opportunities: IPs can continue to engage with financial service providers – both microfinance institutions and commercial banks that are committed to working with women- to\ndesign and promote gender-sensitive financial products.\n\nEffective monitoring: Investing in monitoring, evaluation, and learning at the IP level is critical, both to improve internal practices and to understand how to motivate the private sector to expand its role in women’s empowerment.",

      "Key Findings": "Private health providers of immunisation services have especially been critical in filling the gaps in government services in hard-to-reach or conflict-affected areas and among marginalised populations, and thus in reducing inequities in access. Through its experience in engaging the private sector, Sudan has learned the importance of regulating and licencing private facilities and incorporating them into the immunisation programme’s decision-making, planning, regular evaluation and supervision system to ensure their compliance with immunisation guidelines and the overall quality of services. In moving forward, strategic engagement with the private sector will become more prominent as Sudan transitions out of donors’ financial assistance with its projected income growth.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Future initiatives and studies should consider the demand aspects (eg, experiences and perceptions of the beneficiaries towards private facilities and quality of care), the quality of data reporting, and missed opportunities for vaccination. Additionally, government and partners\nshould review the dynamics between state-level regulators/ authorities and private providers and include a comparative analysis of the states and their determinants for effective engagement with the private sector. It is also important to understand the role of external assistance—particularly to NGOs—and how a potential reduction or disruption in\nfunding may impact service delivery in conflict-affected\nand low-resource areas.",

      "Document Title": "Private sector engagement and contributions to immunisation service delivery and coverage in Sudan",
      "Key Findings": "Private providers have made an important contribution to\nSudan’s immunisation programme and its efforts to improve vaccination coverage—from 62% for diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis third dose in 2000 to 95% for Penta3 in 2017 (using WHO–Unicef estimates). Moreover, as in Malawi, private facilities in Sudan participate in ‘cost sharing’ by providing the venues, health personnel, some of the cold chain and running costs.\nWithout the private sector, the government would need to significantly increase its capital investment in health facilities and recurring personnel cost to fill gaps in services, especially in states like Khartoum. \nYet, this engagement has faced a number of challenges. For example, despite the government oversight described above, there are anecdotes of suboptimal quality standards and of the private sector charging ‘fees’ to beneficiaries for\nvaccination. Therefore, a key lesson learnt is the importance of the licencing process for private facilities and incorporating them into the immunisation programme’s regular supervision and quality assurance system to ensure compliance with immunisation guidelines and policy. the experience in Sudan demonstrates the importance of making private providers feel that they are part of or have ownership in the delivery system and are accountable to it by taking part in regular planning, training, review and decision-making activities.\n\nOther key findings included:\n1. The global immunisation community is increasingly urging countries to engage more closely with the private sector in coordinating, planning and monitoring immunisation activities, particularly to reduce inequities in availability of services between geographic areas and population groups and increase overall coverage of immunisation services.\n2. Given the prolonged conflict, economic turmoil and limited human and institutional capacity of the government, Sudan has explored innovative ways of regulating, integrating and expanding partnerships with private providers to deliver health and immunesation services to inaccessible and difficult-to-reach populations.\n3. Overall, private/non-governmental health providers administered approximately 16% of the third dose of pentavalent vaccine given to children in 2017.\n4. In moving forward, ensuring effective public–private collaboration will become more critical to address service gaps and inequities especially as Sudan, with its projected income growth, is preparing to enter the accelerated Gavi transition phase, during which financial support will wind down.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Future initiatives and studies should consider the demand aspects (eg, experiences and perceptions of the beneficiaries towards private facilities and quality of care), the quality of data reporting, and missed opportunities for vaccination. Additionally, government and partners should review the dynamics between state-level regulators/authorities and private providers and include a comparetive analysis of the states and their determinants for effective engagement with the private sector.

SEUH efficiency was evident mostly in its work with the FMoH, RHBs, C/THOs, and the health centers.\n\n3. SEUH contributed to the increasing availability of human resources for health (HRH) through CPHT,\nIRT, and LMG training.\n\n4. Most of the SEUH results are far from being sustainable due to resource limitations.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. UHEP’s various priorities require multiple sources and support mechanisms beyond USAID.\n\n2. Future activities should continue to strengthen the capacity of government offices to lead UHEP\nimplementation.\n\n3. To ensure sustainability, future activities should strengthen the capacity of specific government offices at the RHB and C/THO to analyze, convene, and lead the dissemination and data use efforts. \n\n4.

      "Key Findings": "Through the team’s research, the rural sector of Southern Bangladesh is revealed to be a crowded mosaic of tiny plots of land that barely support the livelihoods of myriad hardworking farming households.\n\nProducers seemingly operate independently, not to say alone, buying and selling as individual units, despite potential for lower input prices and higher output prices of purchases and sales made in bulk. \n\nThe organization of farmers into groups for business purposes was not found to be a common practice, nor was it a standard component of IPs’ implementation strategies, contrary to international best practice in rural development circles.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Strengthen focus on GAP and build alliances with the district-level DAEs to disseminate GAP principles as widely as possible, using male and female field agents to spread the technology and train producers in its application.\n2. Project-driven interventions should remain as an optional intervention modality to enhance desired impact on the economic empowerment of women in the targeted MS. \n3. Make women empowerment a targeted and specifically monitorable outcome through tailored\nand effective project-driven interventions. \n4. To ensure full application of the MS approach (i.e., with due attention to support functions and the role of government and women farmer organizations), work closely and holistically with one “Bibhag” or divisional administration to strengthen support functions of one promising MS with high women IGA potential. \n5. Explore concrete options to set up capital loan bank guarantee services to female-headed agribusinesses at experienced commercial banks that actively support rural sector enterprise.\n6. Market the IP projects to the selected banks as the quality assurance provider of MS development activities – being less experienced in agriculture, they will need that reassurance to fully engage with beneficiaries.",

      "Key Findings": "The complexity of public–private partnership (PPP) projects ensures that risks could emerge and spread in unpredictable ways if they are not well identified and managed. The emergence of PPP projects has brought major changes in the construction industry, the most notable being in procurement methods influencing risk allocation to private parties. Thus, it is crucial to have an effective risk management for public and private partners to eliminate or minimise risks. Formulating an effective risk management system is a crucial challenge faced by both of parties in order to minimise or optimise risks. The aim of this study was to investigate the process of risk identification of private partners in Malaysian PPP projects. Data were collected throughout a 2-month period using a survey with a sample of nine Malaysian companies engaged in PPP projects, and the survey results were analysed using mean scores. The findings indicate that due to a lack of knowledge and experience of Malaysian private partners in the risk identification process, a comprehensive database for risk identification is highly necessary for the private sector. Another issue emerging from the findings is that it may be reasonable to use a combination of risk identification tools for PPP projects with a high level of complexity. The findings of the present study can greatly assist public and private partners to select the most appropriate tools for risk identification at the early stages of PPP projects.",

      "Document Summary": "This case study examines how AgDevCo’s investment in Saise, Zambia’s first seed potato producer, contributes to the expansion of the value chain and encourages commercial farming.  AgDevCo has given over $128 million to aid commercial agriculture businesses in eight countries in Africa. AgDevCo hopes to stimulate the Zambian economy with its partnership while working with Saise to partner with smallholder farmers. Its goal is to help create jobs and raise incomes and so far it has created 95 full time equivalent jobs, increased female participation in the workforce, benefitted smallholder farmers, and increased income for smallholder farmers. The potato value chain has been impacted by providing a transformational change due to the newly formed/expanded industries. ",
      "Key Findings": "Although it is only three years since the initial investment was made, there are already emerging signs of transformational change. While there is some evidence that community uplift in the Mbala area will occur in the future as Saise injects income into local businesses both by purchasing goods and services and increasing incomes, Saise’s transformational impact mostly lies in the way it impacts the Zambian potato value chain. Figure 4, which summarises the logical pathway from Saise’s investment level changes to the expected transformational impact, shows how by producing local inputs in a newly established industry and neglected region, Saise is contributing to future crowding-in. This can be expected to happen through demonstration effects, efficiency gains and to a lesser extent by increasing demand for agricultural inputs and services.",

The DIBs pilot program runs for six years and gave 6.3 million pounds for three projects, “ICRC: Humanitarian Impact Bond for Physical Rehabilitation; Village Enterprise: Micro-Enterprise Poverty Graduation Impact Bond; and Support to British Asian Trust: to design impact bonds for education and other outcomes in South Asia.” The report aims to test whether DIBs are a tool that DFID can use and add value to DFID programs to support commissioning, management, and effectiveness of programs. The document gives many recommendations: be transparent, make contracts, build a database on interest rates, and prioritize the documentation of lessons learned. ",
      "Key Findings": "The lessons of potential wider relevance for the design and set up phase of DIBs. These are split out against the DIB effects and different stages of designing and setting up DIBs. As discussed in section 3, there is not yet a predominant design for DIBs, and it is perhaps more helpful to understand DIBs as a funding class within which there is great\nvariation. The precise structure and nature of the DIBs depend on the stakeholders involved, their objectives for using the DIB and the organisational and regulatory requirements in place. These have implications for the DIB effects and for the process of design and set up phase. This diversity must be borne in mind when taking stock of the lessons learned to date.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations to all DIB stakeholders\n• Be transparent and share lessons learned and key successes and failures (including DIBs that failed to launch) to facilitate dissemination of learning across the sector;\n• Make contracts, payment terms, feasibility studies, investor documents and learning documents publicly available;\n• Building a database on interest rates, outcome metrics and rate cards and drawing on private sector expertise on pricing risk would facilitate the growing of the DIBs market;\n• Prioritise the documentation of lessons learned and evaluation, in order to facilitate the development of a more finely grained understanding of what works, and in what contexts.\nRecommendations to DIB designers\n• Clearly agree upfront the roles and responsibilities of all involved parties, including how these responsibilities may change depending on circumstances;\n• When structuring the DIB, ensure that the contracts and governance arrangements have provisions for a range of potential eventualities;\n• Be clear about the objectives of using the DIB, and how the DIB is expected to resolve a policy problem. Then, structure the DIB so it focuses on delivering the targeted DIB effects, and seek to reduce transaction costs that do not contribute to the targeted effects of using the DIB. Be clear what is needed from stakeholders, including investors, outcome funders and advisors. This can affect whether hands-on or hands-off stakeholders are more appropriate.\n• Consider carefully the number and types of stakeholders involved, as, in this early stage of the market, complexities and potential inefficiencies increase with the number of stakeholders. Consider solutions to reduce this complexity, such as limiting the number of stakeholders involved or using contractual arrangements that simplify the processes required.\n• Develop outcome metrics and rate cards that are understood by all stakeholders and linked to other metrics used in the sector or country, to increase the value of the learning generated, minimise the costs of data collection and facilitate the broader DIB market and/or potential transition to a SIB.\n• Collaboration is important to reducing transaction costs. Seek to draw on the expertise and experience of stakeholders within the DIB.\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "Strengthening Implementation Effectiveness and Sustainability:\n• CITIES should focus more on contextually nuanced and technical training than awareness raising efforts especially when targeting municipal staff and leadership.\n• To the extent possible, CITIES should tie grants to needs identified in the needs manual sanctioned by official process.\n• CITIES should support the unification of all capacity building efforts under one institutional umbrella whether it is MOMA’s training directorate or another institution to increase\nsustainability and advocate that such efforts are sequenced to ensure effectiveness and knowledge retention and application.\n\nSynergy:\n• USAID and CITIES should continue, and increasingly take an active role, to strengthen inter-donor coordination related to support for municipal services and decentralization.\n• CITIES and the next ET should support efforts to capture learning generated by the multiple donors in the same development space as CITIES, and its application.",

      "Document Title": "Adopting a Market Based Approach to Boost Energy Access in Displaced Contexts",
      "Key Findings": "• Development of long-term energy solutions in displacement settings tends to be perceived as investment that falls outside the remit of emergency responses. In addition,\nwhen emergency energy supply measures are implemented they often result in expensive, unreliable and unhealthy energy provision for those in protracted or recurrent crises.\n• There is widespread agreement among humanitarian and development experts that an effective refugee response should include long-term development solutions as well as\nemergency relief.\n• The energy access imperative is more pronounced when considering the need for effective energy distribution in practically all camp activities and basic necessities: pumping and treatment of clean water; heating and cooling for food storage and cooking; energy for\nlivelihood activities; and provision of light for schooling, hospitals and the prevention of violence against women and children.\n• Minor shifts in household energy use to basic solar lighting options and non-wood fuels would save $303 million annually on refugee fuel costs.\n• Within refugee contexts in Kenya and Burkina Faso, the MEI sought to examine opportunities to use market interventions, rather than in-kind distributions, to improve clean energy access over the long-term and test the delivery of market-based approaches.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The MEI projects in Burkina Faso and Kenya have provided the perfect opportunity to take risks and showcase the potential for a different development approach. The MEI’s research – from energy market assessments to intervention delivery – has shown that there is a case for improving energy access for displaced populations and their hosts through market-based approaches.\nAlthough the overall objectives of the projects have yet to be realized, there are many useful lessons for any sector working on market-based approaches in a protracted displacement context.\nImportantly, the MEI has not only articulated the intervention activities conducted in each country, but also assessed the contextual, operational and programmatic factors that influence their successful design and delivery. These lessons are often lost as the humanitarian and development sectors try to find the perfect market-intervention activity (noting that there will never be a ‘one size fits all’ intervention), but they are important in facilitating success.\nSharing practical experience and delivering training to support practitioners in designing and delivering optimum market interventions, although valuable, will be ineffective if they are working in an operating environment that will ultimately undermine these efforts.\nIt is futile to try to deliver market-based approaches in isolation in a constantly changing, protracted-crisis context that is heavily distorted by the activities of other aid agencies. Sustaining the outcomes of any market-based intervention will be contingent on effective communication and decision-making by others in the aid sector.\nMulti-stakeholder forums should use the results of the MEI projects to facilitate difficult discussions on what is an acceptable outcome in protracted displacement contexts, on how aid agencies position themselves throughout the crisis life cycle, and on how this affects the role, coordination and collaboration of agencies.",

      "Key Findings": "Despite impressive global progress on education over the last several decades, pressing challenges remain in improving access and learning, and mobilizing adequate resources. However, this report finds that education PPPs are not a shortcut to success, and that their claimed benefits amount to false promises. A growing body of academic evidence shows that PPPs do not consistently deliver better education outcomes and at the same time are deepening inequality in education. Particular concerns are raised by market-oriented approaches that fund for-profit private schools or seek to expand competitive markets for education, creating incentives for exclusion and socioeconomic segregation. Low-fee private schools have been shown to disproportionately exclude girls and exploit the labor rights of teachers, who are predominantly women in many countries. \n\nHowever, this report finds that the World Bank is actively advising countries to adopt a PPP approach in education and expand the role of private education provision through its SABER policy advice. Oxfam’s research also finds the World Bank’s financing portfolio for this approach, while still modest, is significant and growing. Case studies from Uganda and Pakistan highlight the Bank’s instrumental role in supporting the expansion of private education provision through its policy advice and lending. Taken together with increased direct funding of commercial schools through the IFC, these trends are cause for deep concern.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- The World Bank should cease its advocacy and funding for market oriented education PPPs, especially those that support low-fee and commercial private schools, and instead redouble its focus on supporting governments to strengthen public education provision. It should redesign or do away with its SABER policy advice on the private sector. The International Finance Corporation should stop funding K-12 commercial schools.\n- Governments should devote the maximum available resources to public education including at least six percent of GDP and 20 percent of national budgets, and avoid diverting scarce public resources and attention away from the essential task of building free, good-quality, inclusive public schools. They should adequately regulate private education providers, especially commercial schools. \n- The Global Partnership for Education and other donors should focus their support on improving the provision of public schooling in developing countries, and should not fund market-oriented education PPPs, especially those that support low-fee and commercial private schools. Donors should substantially increase their aid commitments to education, stop funding commercial schools through their private finance arms, and insist that the World Bank reorient its approach away from PPPs and commercial schools.\n- All actors must ensure that their efforts are compatible with the progressive realization of the right to education and gender equality.",

      "Key Findings": "The sustainable development goals (SDGs) of Transforming our world, the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, and specifically SDG 17, call for cooperation, collaboration and partnership between government, civil society and businesses. To reach the agenda’s objectives, the international community needs to find ways to effectively harness the public and private sectors. The SDGs are integrated and indivisible, with progress in one area dependent upon progress in others. Both the private and public sector are needed to meet the health-related SDG 3, including the target of universal health coverage (UHC) and related goals such as SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure).",
      "Key Recommendations": "Here we suggest the following approach to managing, and where appropriate, engaging the private sector as part of efforts to achieve UHC.\n\nFirst, governments should take the lead and formulate domestic health goals and priorities.\n\nSecond, as the private sector is heterogeneous, context-specific policy approaches are required to align the work of the private sector with the goal of achieving UHC.\n\nThird, is implementation of the government’s policy on the role of the private sector for UHC, with a mix of legal and financial regulatory tools to manage the private sector and steer efforts towards achieving UHC.",

Globally, the private sector has and will continue to provide new practices and perspectives that contribute to improvements in the effectiveness of assistance.

      "Key Recommendations": "As an additional checklist for innovative and positive action, we propose the following key actions to advance progress in humanitarian/private sector partnerships:\n\n• Build a solution-focused project team, avoiding internal silos and being open-minded to new ways of working. The ‘Agile’ approach provides a useful starting point, as does the ‘scrum’12 project management method and other innovative approaches such as ‘design thinking.\n• Be social and communicate about the process as well as the outcome –commit to the advancement of the entire humanitarian sector, not just the organization with whom you partner.\n• Create and stick to a partnership charter as well as the contract – to build mutual trust and equitable status.\n• Don’t underestimate the power of an inspired individual – we are all innovators with the ability to initiate or to drive positive change in the humanitarian sector.\n• Don’t let internal ‘naysayers’ hold you back – neither sector yet has the answer to everything, but the pace of positive impact is faster and more effective when we work together.",

      "Document Title": "Hurricane Florence: Building resilience for the new normal",
      "Key Findings": "Our key findings revolve around a variety of human, social, economical and political themes. Society continues to support and subsidize investment and unprotected development in high-risk areas such as exposed coasts and river inlets. Insurance that does not accurately price for risk exacerbates the problem. The consequences of Hurricane Florence themselves were exacerbated by secondary failures and losses beyond the immediate property losses, such as outflow and subsequent contamination of the environment by harmful human, agricultural and industrial waste. These problems are technologically solved but are not socio-economically implemented in many cases. This calls for better regulation in some situations where it is not yet available, and in others for a better enforcement where regulation already exists.\n\nSome of these consequences, especially as they occur downstream of big industrial and agricultural complexes, but also in less affluent environments, hit the socially vulnerable the most. We have seen not only in Florence but earlier events that floods and other natural hazards contribute to marginalizing vulnerable populations and communities.\n\nOn a more technical level, we still find that adequate hazard mapping, identifying and managing risk through exposure and vulnerability control, communicating possible consequences as early warning messages, and getting stakeholders to take the right and timely action are challenging. Not everyone evacuated when they should have, others did not take adequate precautions to limit losses and consequences, and many failed to understand the consequences that Florence would bring. In part, explaining how dangerous storms can be only by identifying the wind force using the Saffir-Simpson-Scale is missing the flood threat that such storms bring more often and more intensely.\n\nThe key insights and recommendations outlined in this report are part of a wider series of post-event reviews, using the Post Event Review Capability (PERC) methodology, that the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance has been conducting since 2013. The trends are clear – impacts from disasters are getting worse. After a disaster there is rarely the time to learn what happened and what could be done better in the future. However, the recovery period is also a key window of opportunity to take action to reduce future risk. The PERC methodology (publicly available at: floodresilience.net/PERC ) helps meet this urgent need. PERCs generate actionable recommendations for reducing future damages right when they are needed most5. The aim is to answer questions related to various aspects of flood resilience, including flood risk management, catastrophe intervention and recovery. It looks at what has worked well, shares best practices, and identifies opportunities where there is room for further improvements. This report follows 13 PERC studies conducted over the past five years and adds to the global insights gathered from previous big flood events. It also complements prior studies conducted in the U.S. by ISET-International and the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance following flooding from intense rainfall – in Boulder, Colorado in 2013\n– from intense rainfall and high tides – the South Carolina floods of 2015 – as well as from flooding from a slow moving immense storm\n– Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Texas in 2017.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Broad recognition that flooding is a regional challenge and needs a regional response.\n• Direct acknowledgment of the underlying issues and recognition that addressing those issues will require a much stronger watershed approach.\n• Direct action to build intergovernmental coordination across municipalities and counties and increase the spectrum of departments and decision makers involved. For example, the importance of land zoning in building flood resilience is becoming increasingly apparent and entities involved in land use across the region are being encouraged to come to the table and collaborate.\n• Recognition that implementing isolated solutions is not enough. Resources need to be coordinated and consistent engagement will be required to make a real difference.\n• Acknowledgement that resilience projects are very expensive and the federal government is currently not supporting them. However, delaying until there is funding isn’t an option. Instead, the cities and counties themselves are going to have to figure out how to identify the funding to secure their future.",

      "Key Findings": "The recent global economic and financial crisis has generated new challenges for all public governments. In a number of countries, anti-crisis packages included innovative public actions, realized also in combination with private investments, like in the case of public-private partnership (PPP), which combines the resource of government agents with those of private agents in order to realize public-interest aims. In this study, we have conducted a general analysis on PPP models, in order to present some evidences from a comparison between European Union with 28 countries (EU-28) and Italy in the 2008-2016 period, with specific considerations on the energy sector. The various trends demonstrate a substantial evolution about global numbers and values of the PPP initiatives in EU-28 and Italy, and underline several constraints and challenges for successful PPP projects, even specifically for the energy sector.",

To do\nthis, the GOI needs to establish a strong national and provincial team responsible for health policy development and quality assurance, located at the Ministry of Health (MOH) and assigned the following tasks:\n• Develop policy briefs based on promising approaches, including those from the USAID MNH portfolio lessons learned review, to be disseminated to relevant policymakers and key stakeholders.\n• Reform health policies to better address and strengthen critical aspects of health system programs, including quality of care, local governance, the Eastern Indonesia health system, private sector engagement, and use of data for decision-making.\n• Develop national- and provincial-level strategies with clear instructions and guidelines for health policy and program implementation.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Improving quality of care through an online referral system, mentoring of all health facilities, accreditation of health facilities, audits of maternal and neonatal deaths, and ANC for early detection and management of eclampsia/pre-eclampsia.\n\nReliance on local governance for community engagement for managing basic health care services, integrated health program planning, and evidence-based health advocacy at the local level.\n\nOther recommendations include strengthening the health system in eastern Indonesia, private sector engagement, using data for decision-making, and sustaining and scaling up promising approaches.

      "Key Findings": "Private Equity (PE) funds faced key prudential roadblocks in the cost-effective investment and repatriation of their funds. Conventionally, PE funds provide equity financing to target companies; however, in case of debt financing instruments, PE management companies registered abroad are constrained by rigid caps on the debt charges that can be applied to companies receiving debt financing.\n\nSECP, the main regulatory institution for eWRS, was essential to\nexpediting the Collateral Management Companies (CMC) Regulations (May 2017), which successfully encouraged eWRS pilots in wheat, paddy, and maize.\n\nThe respective GoP agencies lacked the capacity to implement the AML supervisory manual. FMD formulated the strategy so that the supervisory manual could be implemented as early as possible.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Follow-on programming is recommended to ensure that domestic PE funds are permitted to raise capital from pension funds and provident funds; and foreign PE funds will be allowed to invest in domestic securities.\n\nTwo steps are necessary for a rapid launch of the eWHR regime:\n1. SECP issues the first CMC license; and\n2. SBP includes eWHRs as collateral in its prudential regulations.\n\nIn order to ameliorate the above constraints, we recommend that the Finance and Project Management departments of each government should form a joint \"data\" office that would take ownership for loan and project data. This would greatly help the government to streamline the process of analyzing the debt portfolio.",

      "Document Title": "Private Sector Humanitarians? New Approaches in the Global Refugee Response",
      "Key Findings": "While companies and humanitarian agencies have traditionally engaged in a variety of ways, ranging from commercially driven procurement relationships to philanthropically oriented ventures, we focus on socially responsible partnerships. These aims to generate gains for businesses while producing value for refugees through humanitarian agencies – a surprisingly rare occurrence. We draw several lessons:\n\n- Private companies and humanitarian organizations face significant startup costs. Both entities lack a shared world view, which could create mutual mistrust requiring significant time and resources to overcome. These upfront costs can be prohibitive, especially for non-profits.\n\n- Local intermediaries play a key role in the inception of a successful partnership. Local civil society organizations or governments match private companies to compatible non-profits. This informal facilitation bypasses information asymmetries, reduces risks, and mitigates competitive tendencies that can become significant barriers to partnership creation.\n\n- The most successful partnerships are flexible, supported strongly by senior leadership with clear goals and open communication. Highly active communication channels, especially with leaders from each of the partners, help resolve issues quickly and build trust. Establishing clear understandings of motivations and expectations of both parties reduces uncertainty, setting a partnership up for success.\n\n- Private entities must build have a clear and robust business case for serving refugees. They offer a real-world testing opportunity and an untapped potential market for products and services, incentivizing companies to work through humanitarian agencies by providing free or highly subsidized products and services to refugees. By combining the profit motive with philanthropic goals, partnerships benefit both the private entity and the refugees they help.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on these insights, we offer several recommendations to promote the advancement of future partnerships to tackling pressing issues facing the humanitarian system. We propose setting up a global refugee clearinghouse, with an international secretariat and strong regional presence, to help match private companies with compatible humanitarian organizations. Through a small staff and a network of local member organizations, it would help overcome information asymmetries, provide partner due diligence and undertake monitoring, evaluation and learning through rigorous research. More research will thus help increase the awareness of these partnership and provide insights on how to overcome common barriers. By providing employment and the provision of services, private-humanitarian partnerships offer a novel and promising approach to the global refugee crisis.",

      "Key Findings": "Disaster preparedness in Kenya is perceived to be fragmented, with the country often better at reactive rather than pro-active action. It has been difficult to get definitive answers on where agencies' mandates begin and end but it is clear that there are many different organisations and government agencies handling different elements of disaster preparedness and response. When it comes to MSMEs, most of them do not have elaborate structures for disaster risk management due to the informal nature of their business. Most Micro enterprises are risk averse and have a tendency to react to the aftermath of a disaster when it happens.",
      "Key Recommendations": "a) HPPP can work towards strengthening MSMEs disaster coping strategies need to be through certain measures for example; a) promoting a preparedness culture whereby business owners will see the need to have contingency plans to recover from disasters.\n\nb) Facilitate advocacy through the relevant stakeholders for timely support of MSMEs through building of basic services and infrastructure in case of complex emergencies in order to\nminimize the financial burden on MSMEs and provide linkages to service providers and Government for preparedness and recovery financial assistance.\n\nc) Engage the NDMA and NDOC for the active participation and inclusion of the private sector in disaster management preparedness initiatives by the Government.\n\nd) In order to ensure the HPPP platform strengthens its founding mandate, commitment by member businesses and organizations to the Charter and vision from 2016 and adheres to Asia Preparedness Partnership and ADPC (2018) ; Engaging the private sector in preparedness for response : Experiences from the Asian Preparedness Partnership; Engaging companies in manmade disasters – a guidance toolkit for private sector networks humanitarian standards in disaster preparedness, response and recovery should be reinvigorated. HPPP aims to provide a more structured opportunity for humanitarian, business and Government together with community representatives to effectively share information on opportunities and needs. The platform will continue to facilitate networking, collaboration and opportunities to address humanitarian needs through innovation and shared-value creation. The platform will also ensure all parties are integral participants in government-led disaster management from preparedness planning, to humanitarian response and early recovery. HPPP aims at improved information sharing, coordination and joint leverage for impact to improve disaster resilience. \n\ne) From the findings; it is important that HPPP considers linking up disaster affected MSMEs with opportunities for rebuilding their businesses back through financial and insurance institutions in order to hasten the recovery process.",

Sine the summer of 2018 flooding in and around Abidjan, private sector attention has been directed more towards natural hazards. Lack of information and understanding on manmade disasters in general and the Ivorian context is a clear barrier to private sector engagement. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "As inter-community violence is considered as one of the main manmade challenges at the moment, La Plateforme Humanitaire du Secteur Privé de Côte d'Ivoire (PHSP) should consider localized instead of national level activities. It will have to further strengthen the business case or rationale for private sector engagement. ",

      "Document Summary": "This discussion paper examines climate finance in Kenya based on the policy goals set by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS). In Kenya, the effects of climate change are severe and it is one of the most vulnerable countries in Africa. This paper discusses how financial services can be used to benefit the climate and shows how Kenya can build robust climate finance mechanisms. Kenya has set up policies to help mobilize climate finance with strategies that include private sector partners. Although there has been progress, Kenya needs to manage and diversify its resources. It also needs to move funds from the national to the local to create more opportunities and create links between national climate financial mechanisms and county ones. ",
      "Key Findings": "Overall, the experience with the climate finance mechanism in Kenya shows that the country has made progress but there is huge opportunity to develop a robust system and be a regional leader in climate financing. So far, the country has made good progress in setting up policies and institutional arrangements to help mobilise, allocate and monitor climate finance. The various policy instruments set out by the government to enhance processes of climate financing paint a progressive future. The National Policy on Climate Finance seeks to position the country to better access climate finance through a variety of well-thought-out strategies to be executed through public–private partnerships.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The experience with Kenya’s finance mechanism show that the country has a huge opportunity to develop a robust climate system and become a regional leader in climate financing. So far, the country has made good progress in terms of setting up policies and institutional arrangements to help mobilise, allocate and monitor climate finance. The various policy instruments set out by the government to enhance processes of climate financing paints a picture of a progressive future. The National Policy on\nClimate Finance seeks to position the country to better access climate finance through a variety of well-thought-out strategies and action plans to be implemented through public–private partnerships. There is also a need to enhance linkages with the broader non-state actors including NGOs and other stakeholders so as to tap into various opportunities including learning and best practices. Open and transparent dialogue between national and county governments, business, long-term investors, and microfinance, banking and development institutions will be important to address. \nDespite the relatively well-established national systems, the country still faces some challenges in managing diverse sources of climate finance. More specifically, monitoring, evaluation implementation and the impact of climate change interventions remains weak. Mechanisms to identify the sources and track how the finance has been utilised have still not been actualised, yet these are international standards required in climate finance and this may prevent the country from accessing some funds. The NACCP 2018–2022 sets out when these mechanisms should be developed but this is still a long way off and requires sufficient political funding to actualize. Enhanced political will is needed to ensure that these goals are not pushed to the next climate action plan. Improved tracking of climate change-related inflows and expenditures should be integrated into national budgetary processes, including identification and\ncoding of climate change expenditure.\nFurthermore, despite a robust national institutional framework, there is need for key institutions to engage in clear communication on progress and give regular updates for accountability purposes such as Office of the Auditor General, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission etc. The national and county governments, the private sector, academia and civil society have a large enough reach to channel climate finance initiatives. However, potential implementing and executing entities have limited capacity to deal with eligibility criteria and modalities of various funds.\nDevolution of climate funds remains a major component of climate financing because this will help ensure that resources reach where they are needed most. However, there is a need to enhance the institutional connection between national government and sub-national level as this currently remains weak. While county governments provide a good opportunity to create institutional linkages for devolving funds from the national to local, there are no clear linkages between national climate financial mechanisms and county ones.

      "Document Title": "Landscape Assessment Report on Private Sector's Engagement in Disaster Management in Vietnam ",
      "Key Findings": "Some communities were found to be quite resilient to disasters while others are not. The difference, as the assessment team observed, is that some communities, like Hoi An City in Quan Nam Province, historically have learned to adapt to regular flooding, and to respond and recover quickly. On the other hand, provinces like Khanh Hoa were not accustomed to serious storms, and therefore less prepared. \n\nCurrently, the businesses that are more resilient tend to be those that are more urban, more prosperous, or more experienced with coping with disasters. For those businesses that are smaller, more rural, and less experienced, the impacts of disasters are catastrophic. \n\nLarger, more prosperous domestic companies and global corporations are more resilient than smaller local firms. However, to the extent that they rely on local SMEs in their supply chains, they also face substantial risks if their supply chains are not diversified. The Vietnam City Resiliency Index found that the two key drivers for risk management for larger firms are: \n1) experience of disruption to the supply chain; and \n2) the recognition that SMEs in Vietnam have poor risk management strategies. The firms managed their risks through direct collaboration with SMEs in their supply chain, scheduled workshops on disaster risk management, contractual obligations, technical design, insurance, and use of a diversified portfolio of local and regional suppliers that can offset supply from SMEs affected by disasters.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The report recommends further exploration of a private sector network on disaster management that is funded and tasked with advocating for policy, legal and regulatory reforms encompassing all of the above issues. Such an approach will ensure simultaneously both resiliency against disasters and threats to sustained economic growth. \n\nRecommendations for improving public-private sector coordination include:\n1. A bottom-up approach to strengthen the resiliency of communities, such as: practicing community responses comparable to how Hoi An mobilizes as soon as it receives news of a coming flood; public education on the danger of high winds and storms surges, and potential flood paths; and improved guidance to citizens and SMEs on building stronger structures (although some persons interviewed argued against more government regulations for citizens).\n2. Improved regulation and enforcement of construction of infrastructure, such as roadways, drainage and large developments like high-rise buildings and resorts. This would include: higher standards for construction of roofs and utilities; improved enforcement of disaster risk assessments; a Law on Drainage; improved urban planning; and improved management of coastal areas and upstream reservoirs to ensure that the flow of water from storms, including upriver, is effectively managed.\n3. Improved policy-making at both the national and provincial level, including: better oversight, management and accountability of the Disaster Prevention Fund; transition to private sector insurance against storms and floods; and a program to offer some form of tax relief to SMEs that have not yet registered short-term, while continuing to urge them and all household businesses to transition to registering officially as businesses; and improved coordination between the private sector and the government to guide appropriate decision-making.\n4. Improved utilization of information technology so that: offshore wind and storms are more accurately tracked and reported nationally (e.g., so far-off cities can warn persons about travel plans, and fishermen and farmers can make appropriate preparations, further in advance); releases of water from hydro-power dams upriver is tracked and shared in real time; and alerts are issued both through conventional manners and through social media and other online resources so that knowledge is widespread and immediate.\n5. Improved private sector participation in DRM, seizing upon private sector actors already making headway engaging directly with the government.\n6. Increased public education on DRM focused on local businesses, including those that are unregistered, focusing on preparation and mitigation against extreme weather events.\n7. Improved implementation of a workable and transparent system of disaster fund management.",

      "Document Title": "Blended Finance In Fragile Contexts: Opportunities and Risks",
      "Key Findings": "The development community agrees on the need to address conflict and fragility for global security and sustainable development. In such complex situations, that are highly\ninterconnected and often unpredictable, programming should strive to include multiple\nactors at various levels of society. Although the use of private investment in fragile contexts\nhas so far been low, in fear of exploitation and further institutional weakening, the need to address the SDG funding gap makes innovative and more flexible financing methods worth considering. While the use of ODA will remain critical to development, particularly in\nfragile contexts, blended finance can help enlarge the total resources available for development.\nIn order to assess the linkages and potential for implementing blended finance in fragile and conflict-affect contexts, this paper analyses the OECD DAC statistics on amounts\nmobilised from the private sector by official development finance interventions, from 2012\nto 2017, against the multidimensional lens presented in the OECD 2018 States of Fragility Framework. The data shows a positive relationship between blending opportunities and\neconomic, political and environmental security. The amounts of private finance mobilised in 2012-2017 increase, as a country’s economic, political and environmental fragility\ndecreases. The way blended finance interplays with societal fragility and security remains unclear, as these two dimensions exert more complex influence on the trade-off between\nperceived risks and anticipated returns, which typically guides private investors.",

      "Document Title": "Private Sector Peacebuilding: A Review of Past Cases and Lessons Learned",
      "Key Findings": "Private sector engagement in peacebuilding includes a spectrum of activities. Cases in this report include direct engagement in negotiation or peacebuilding, protection of civilians, economic peacebuilding, and several other approaches. There is not one single role for business engagement in peace.\nBusiness association engagement appears to be more related to sustainable peace than single-actor interventions. Because peacebuilding requires a systemic intervention, cases involving business associations or coalitions able to operate at scale seem to be more associated with sustainable peace than single actor interventions.\nIndividuals matter. In the majority of cases, the decision to engage in peacebuilding and the drive with which the business pursued it appears attributable to individual leaders within the company or organization. Finding committed individual partners may be important for effective private sector engagement.\nSuccessful interventions require multiple actors. Sustainable interventions appear to be most effective when the private sector partners are part of a larger system of political and civil society groups working towards peace.\nInnovation has not replaced tried-and-true methods. The cases include several attempts to deliver peace through innovative approaches targeting issues such as military expenditures or interpersonal contact through technology.  In this set of examples, these cases are less effective than interventions focused on more traditional issues of economic development and political engagement.\nThere are multiple motivations for intervention, but economic interests persist across cases. The private sector actors in these cases appear motivated by multiple issues including humanitarian concerns or principles. However, across the cases the most consistent reason for engagement is economic interest and many cases demonstrate a blended approach focusing on economic interest as well as principle.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The emerging consensus of the peacebuilding community emphasizes the necessity for coordinated multidimensional interventions for sustainable peace. While these interventions have some generic conclusions—we know that inclusive development, legitimate governance, and gender and ethnic inclusive systems are universally important tools for UN organizations must, in advance of a partnership, develop an internal understanding that the interest of potential partners may or may not be peace for its own sake. peace—in each specific conflict context they must be rooted in an understanding of local conflict dynamics. Against this background, the cases presented in this report and the existing research on peacebuilding call for a broad consideration of the role of the private sector in peacebuilding. Because private sector actors are embedded in societies at multiple levels, they have the potential to contribute to many aspects of peacebuilding (while being central to issues of development and inclusive economic growth). Engaging the private sector must start with a mapping of conflict dynamics in a target country paired with a mapping of the existing actors in the space, including the private sector. From that mapping, points of entry and engagement between the private sector and conflict analysis can be identified. The PBF guidance note proposes five specific points of entry to consider: the private sector as a source or target for violence, as a provider of sustainable peace-supporting livelihoods, as a source of technical or practical support for peacebuilding, as a source for financial resources for peacebuilding, and as a political actor directly promoting peace through political engagement. Against these five points of entry, projects\nwith specific theories of change and associated strategic plans can be developed. In developing these plans and points of engagement, it is useful to keep in mind the key considerations of the case studies above. Questions of how to work at scale, which private sector actors and which key leaders are engaged and capable of delivering sustained engagement, and what their motivations are will all be central to developing partnerships for sustained peace. Nonetheless, as the case studies presented here demonstrate, the private sector can be an active and committed partner for peace.",

      "Document Title": "PRIVATE SECTOR PEACEBUILDING: A Review of Past Cases and Lessons Learned",
      "Document Summary": "This document examines how the private sector can contribute to peace. Private sector engagement is vital for peacebuilding, “...the secretary-general has acknowledged that the best way to achieve systemic peace is through the coordinated effort of ‘the United Nations, national Governments and other key stakeholders, including international, regional and subregional organizations, international financial institutions, civil society organizations, women’s groups, youth organizations and the private sector.’” The report reviews 12 diverse case studies from around the world to answer the questions of where, when, and how private sector actors have contributed to the peace process. After reviewing the case studies, the report found that the private sector engages in a wide variety of activities, business association engagement is more successful than single-actor interventions, engagement with multiple private sector groups is key, and economic interests are the main motivation for private sector groups to participate in peacebuilding efforts. \n",
      "Key Findings": "1) Private sector engagement in peacebuilding includes a spectrum of activities. Cases in this report include direct engagement in negotiation or peacebuilding, protection of civilians, economic peacebuilding, and several other approaches. There is not one single role for business engagement in peace.\n2) Business association engagement appears to be more related to sustainable peace than single-actor interventions. Because peacebuilding requires a systemic intervention, cases involving business associations or coalitions able to operate at scale seem to be more associated with sustainable peace than single actor interventions.\n3) Individuals matter. In the majority of cases, the decision to engage in peacebuilding and the drive with which the business pursued it appears attributable to individual leaders within the company or organization. Finding committed individual partners may be important for effective private sector engagement.\n4) Successful interventions require multiple actors. Sustainable interventions appear to be most effective when the private sector partners are part of a larger system of political and civil society groups working towards peace.\n5) Innovation has not replaced tried-and-true methods. The cases include several attempts to deliver peace through innovative approaches targeting issues such as military expenditures or interpersonal contact through technology.  In this set of examples, these cases are less effective than interventions focused on more traditional issues of economic development and political engagement.\n6) There are multiple motivations for intervention, but economic interests persist across cases. The private sector actors in these cases appear motivated by multiple issues including humanitarian concerns or principles. However, across the cases the most consistent reason for engagement is economic interest and many cases demonstrate a blended approach focusing on economic interest as well as principle.",

      "Key Findings": "Ultimately, a PPP should not be the end goal, but may be one possible mechanism to reach important health objectives. As governments strive to fill health service gaps, PPPs are increasingly seen across both infrastructure development and service provision in emerging markets. Evidence and opinions vary about the overall efficacy of PPPs, particularly as successful partnerships rely upon a careful balance between risk, true capabilities, and achieving nuanced and sometimes-divergent objectives\nacross different stakeholder groups. Determining whether a PPP has achieved success requires a broad view of desired outcomes and impact across systems and stakeholders. Countries can support PPPs by ensuring enabling regulation and infrastructure is in place, and that PPP models include a broad representation and integration of stakeholders in\ndecision-making processes.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Stronger evaluation of the efficacy and outcomes of PPPs needs to be generated to reduce this uncertainty, particularly in emerging markets.\n2.

      "Key Findings": "This study has found that refugees are currently paying for substandard lighting and power products. OGS\nmarkets – including but not limited to PAYGo products – can meet the needs of refugee and host communities\nin the West Nile region. In order to succeed, markets will require investment and intervention from both the\nhumanitarian and private sector. Refugee settlements and host communities in Uganda’s West Nile region offer\nan important test case for PAYGo solar systems’ ability to meet the energy needs of low-income and sparsely\ndistributed rural populations. In the coming months and years, Mercy Corps, together with partners, will test\nthe hypotheses presented in this study to identify the most appropriate and influential roles and investments for\nhumanitarian, solar and local market and finance actors to close the energy access gap for refugees and host\ncommunities in Uganda.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Strengthening market systems that bring quality energy and financial services to the settlements is a key activity to make the most of limited aid dollars at this stabilization phase of Uganda’s South Sudanese refugee response. A strategy of facilitation and indirect support will minimize unsustainable, blanket aid distributions. Aid agencies\nneed to invest in areas that can generate the most interest to incentivize further adoption by local market actors without further external intervention. The co-creation of strategies and buy-in of local market actors into the interventions is critical for the long-term success of the action and the market itself. Any planned intervention should be given support just long enough that market actors realize the benefits and scale the interventions\nindependently. Successful business models will foster an environment for both non-PAYGo and lower costs of\nPAYGo OGS products, leading to the shared goal of sustainable, high-quality and affordable solar energy\nproducts for households and businesses in humanitarian crises.",

      "Key Findings": "1. Market: Evidence suggests that the project created an emerging market for improved OFS. Substantial smallholder farmer adoption of the technology indicates the presence of demand. Multiple firms compete in the market, though three large firms dominate.\n2. Adoption: Evidence suggests that the competition was successful in scaling up adoption of improved OFS. The competitors’ investments in developing distribution networks and promoting improved OFS to smallholder farmers likely increased adoption by 23 percentage points in Eastern (with 28% of farmers reporting that they adopted in total) and 6 percentage points in Rift Valley (with 10% of farmers reporting they had adopted in total) compared to what the interrupted time series model projects would have happened in the project’s absence. This is a substantial increase: the evaluation projected that without the project, adoption in 2017 would have been 5% in Eastern and 4% in Rift Valley.\n3. Smallholder income and food security: The income and food security impact of OFS adoption was small, with the main benefit of adoption being reduced use of pesticide dust. Adopters increased maize sales revenue by a small amount (nearly US$2 per year per household), but did not reduce their expenditure on maize for consumption. Adopters reduced pesticide dust usage by 36 percentage points, and many reported that reduced pesticide use was the key motivation for adopting\nimproved OFS. In other words, adopters appeared to be substituting one storage technology (improved OFS) for another (traditional storage devices in combination with pesticide dust). Accordingly, the evaluation found that adopters spent just over US$2 less each year on pesticide dust (significant at the 1% level). Adopters’ annual spending on storage containers, however, was on average about US$1 higher than spending by non-adopters (also significant at the 1% level). In order to calculate a total monetary impact at the household level, the evaluation team estimated the combined effect of adoption on revenue net of costs for containers,pesticide dust, and maize purchased for consumption. The difference of about US$3 was not statistically significant.\n4. Scale and cost-effectiveness: The project reached substantial scale, as\nmeasured by the adoption rate. The project cost per household reached was US$39, while the project cost per metric ton of storage sold was US$25.\n5. Sustainability: The supply and demand conditions at endline are indicative of a strong basis for the market to be sustained, although smallholder farmers’ economic returns to adoption are limited in this context.",

To help reduce the spread of the COVID-19\nThe illustrative intermediate outcomes identified below can help the overall outcome of minimizing the number of cases of COVID-19, by contributing towards reduction and containment of the spread of the virus. These include, among others, raising awareness and community support for adopting precautionary measures; providing hygiene facilities and products; and testing, tracking and treating\ncases. While these outcomes are structured specifically with\nCOVID-19 in mind, their benefits can extend beyond the\npandemic.\n\nii. To help minimize the socioeconomic impact on the poor.\nSEs have been proactive in mitigating the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, both in the short and the medium term. In the short term, many have focused on providing basic needs services such as food distribution and cash transfers. Other SEs have been engaged in preserving livelihoods, particularly in the more vulnerable rural areas. Still others have been providing school children with remote education and the sick with telemedicine remote consultations.",
      "Key Recommendations": "(pg. 17) Working with SEs Using RBF Five Recommendations:\n1. Since SEs are already active in responding to the pandemic, RBF can assist them to scale up their work. If GPRBA funding is a possibility, SEs could also take on additional activities – the activity menu need not be limited to existing actions.\n2. Many mature SEs already have robust M&E systems that they use to measure and track their impact, as well as improve their feedback loop. These systems can be audited and used for data collection and verification.\n3. SEs with experience in working with the government should be utilized. For example, BRAC in Bangladesh, Life Bank in Nigeria, and Abwaab in Jordan have already been working with the government on COVID-19 relief measures.\n4. The results and outcome indicators need to be simple and easily verifiable and should build on existing data-collection methods.\n5. Interventions that are likely to have a longer-term impact, should be prioritized when possible—in particular, those that improve country systems and outcomes, allow for benefits to continue to accrue beyond the project funding cycle, and prepare the country for the next emergency.",

      "Key Findings": "FAECAL SLUDGE MANAGEMENT & SOCIAL ENTERPRISE\nMODELS FOR EMERGENCIES GOAL & SANERGY: However, the partnership ran into logistical challenges when GOAL and Sanergy realised the mobile transfer station was too heavy for transport over longer distances. The mobile waste transfer station required access to a treatment centre with high-quality equipment and processes to safely treat and reuse the waste. As Sanergy would not be able to set up waste treatment plants outside Nairobi, the team decided not to trial the solution in refugee camps. EMERGENCY TOILETS LOOWATT: Through the feasibility study, Loowatt identified three key barriers to introducing innovative toilets in humanitarian responses: – Low-tech: Rural response has driven a preference for dug latrines and a view that faecal sludge can be managed using traditional rural solutions that are extremely low-tech. It is expected that any innovation will face this barrier to entry.– Inadequate understanding of the cost of existing solutions: There is a wide range of set-up costs for pit latrine solutions and inadequate documentation of long-term costs related to latrine use – such as pit emptying and disease propagation due to inadequate faecal sludge management (FSM). – Shifting FSM priorities: Over the immediate period (one to two months), the priority is to contain and localise sources of disease; in the short-term (six months), to reduce morbidity and mortality; and in the longterm (several years), to sustain health and\nwell-being. These priorities do not prescribe a consistent approach to FSM, but rather one that evolves over time. LATRINE LIGHT DECIWATT: When the lighting prototype was presented to the experts, the Deciwatt team experienced a lack of interest and never received the detailed feedback and specifications they needed to be able to finalise the design; neither did they secure a humanitarian partner for field testing, so the project was closed. HIF reflected that stakeholder engagement throughout the process could have been better facilitated and supported to strengthen the potential outcomes. FEASIBILITY OF REUSABLE MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS IN HUMANITARIAN PROGRAMMING WOMENA, WELTHUNGERHILFE & PARTNERS: Despite obtaining support from the Ministry of Health and UNHCR in Uganda, the project was unfortunately unable to get ethical approval from local research bodies to commence the study due to concerns related to the lack of studies on menstrual cups in the general population in Uganda and the available WASH facilities in the Bidibidi refugee settlement.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "FAECAL SLUDGE MANAGEMENT & SOCIAL ENTERPRISE MODELS FOR EMERGENCIES GOAL & SANERGY: While Sanergy’s social enterprise model for faecal sludge management in the urban informal settlements of Nairobi is proving successful, there are still a range of remaining questions around its applicability in emergencies. These include how humanitarian incentives work during the early stages of an emergency response, and the potential adverse effect they might have on future market-based solutions. Sanergy are interested in exploring these questions, and in designing and testing a mobile treatment and reuse station in the context of emergency response projects, in order to guarantee waste is safely moved all the way to the end of the sanitation value chain. EMERGENCY TOILETS LOOWATT: The project deepened Loowatt’s knowledge of and engagement in the humanitarian sector. This informed the subsequent pilot of their technology in an urban setting in Malawi in partnership with WASTE advisers on urban environment and development, the FSM in emergencies specialist group. This pilot was successful, and the team are currently planning next steps for scaling the solution.LATRINE LIGHT DECIWATT: The HIF-funded LatrineLight prototype became the foundation for developing new iterations of a lighting solution more appropriate for emergency contexts. Feedback on the prototype led Deciwatt to propose an alternative to the ballast bag that could make the product more versatile and lighter by shifting reliance away from gravity, and instead using a spring and gearing mechanism. This led Deciwatt to develop the Now Light: Gravity Light 03. This nextgeneration light is still human-powered, but also contains a battery. The Gravity Light 03 is lightweight, portable and can be mains charged or solar charged. It is capable of generating 160–180 lumens of watt (very br ght light) for 5–6 hours. It also charges mobile phones and can drive a water purifier. Deciwatt will be targeting the humanitarian market with this lighting solution and are currently trialling it with the Red Cross. FEASIBILITY OF REUSABLE MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS IN HUMANITARIAN PROGRAMMING WOMENA, WELTHUNGERHILFE & PARTNERS: Thanks to the donation of 400 reusable pads from AFRIpads and approval from the HIF to spend some of the remaining project budget on closure activities, WoMena Uganda and Welthungerhilfe carried out community dialogues, a stakeholder meeting with UNHCR and other humanitarian actors, refresher trainings and distribution of menstrual hygiene kits to 400 out of the planned 2000 women. As one of the main concerns raised by the ethical approval committee was related to the use of menstrual cups in a refugee population, the project team decided to exclude menstrual cups from closure activities. They also decided to distribute the menstrual hygiene kits in only four out of the 13 target communities to ensure that Welthungerhilfe would be able to provide continued support to those communities, ensure effective use of the products distributed and collect monitoring and evaluation data on the activities for continued learning, rather than reach all target communities. The menstrual health education sessions raised a lot of interest and local community members have continued to emphasise the need to address Menstrual health and hygiene (MHH) in their communities. They have also expressed an openness to tackle the taboos and stigma surrounding MHH and thus pave the way for future MHH interventions in the area. WoMena is developing a two pager for distribution to stakeholders to explain the information available on menstrual cups safety to help with this.",

The senior managers and leadership at JFC believed\nthat supporting the smallholder farmer was important, and that it ensured continued commercial success.\n3. One of the most successful FEP initiatives took place in an \narea where the mayor saw, understood and valued the partnership with JGF. Policy makers and regulators also had strong roles and responsibilities in leveling the playing field in regard to finding ways of improving business relationships between smallholder farmers and buyers.\n4. The cooperatives were geographically scattered to reduce the risk of regional weather uncertainties and to diversify the crops farmed.\n5. Many of the partner companies were unaware of the impact they had on smallholder farmers that happened to be women. This lack of awareness was a missed opportunity and amplified operational risk.\n6. Economic opportunities trickled throughout the community in the form of crop production, storage and food processing, and these activities offered new jobs for the elderly, youth and women.\n7. Scaling the project required the full participation of several partners, and coordination across multiple partners was more difficult than anticipated.\n",

      "Document Title": "Public-Private Partnerships for Health in Vietnam: Issues and Options",
      "Key Findings": "1. This report shows that health care public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been used widely in developed countries as well as in lower-middle-income countries.\n2. In Vietnam, the gap between the need for investment and the capacity of the state to finance it has focused government attention on the mobilization of private resources for public development goals, including through PPP models.\n3. Designing and implementing health PPPs in Vietnam is constrained by significant barriers in the legal framework, institutional arrangement, and capacity of both the public and private sectors.\n\nAchievements in implementing health care infrastructure and service delivery PPPs are modest. Out of three signed health PPP contracts, a BOO contract for the development of a 500-bed general hospital was terminated; a BOT contract for the development of a 200-bed on-demand hospital, although effective since 2014, has been having problems for several years; and a BT contract for the construction of a public health university, although completed, missed the opportunity to have the private sector share in the maintenance responsibility.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Four of the regulated contract types—Build-Lease-Transfer, Build-Transfer-Lease, Build-Operate-Transfer, and Build-Transfer-Operate—are feasible in the health sector.\n2. In the long term, the government of Vietnam should reorient health PPPs toward equity and efficiency, two fundamental objectives of the national health system.\n3. Vietnam is developing a PPP Investment Law, and this is a great opportunity to refine PPP concepts and optimize the processes and procedures for PPP project development.\n4. The PPP Investment Law should include a clear description of the purpose and the required content for each phase of the procurement process.\n5. Rather than focusing on inputs, PPP contracts should specify the required outputs or desired outcomes and link payments to the project company to the achievement of these outputs and outcomes.\n6. The PPP legal and regulatory framework should set clear requirements on when unsolicited proposals should be allowed, and, where possible, unsolicited proposals should be subject to a competitive procurement process.\n7. The PPP Investment Law should allow ASAs to provide financial support, including construction subsidies, availability payments, and guarantees.\n8. The PPP Investment Law and related legal documents should also describe in detail the roles and responsibilities of government agencies and ASAs for managing fiscal commitments associated with PPPs.\n9. The Ministry of Health (MOH) should develop a circular guiding the screening, preparation, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of health PPP projects in line with equity and efficiency objectives.\n10. Institutional arrangements within the health sector for managing public-private engagements (PPEs) and PPPs also need to be strengthened.\n11. PPP units at the central and provincial levels should estimate and mobilize resources for developing health PPP projects, where appropriate.\n12. Public health managers should be trained to develop sufficient competencies to prepare and implement health PPPs.\n13. Further development of the private sector and communication with potential investors both create more opportunities for the public sector to build effective and sustainable partnerships on health care PPP projects.\n14. Finally, the development of local capital markets can improve the availability of long-term financing for health PPP projects.\n\nIn the current context, health PPP models and contracts should be adopted with caution. The “asset-heavy, service-light” PPP models, such as equipment PPPs and facility PPPs, seem to be the most feasible options. Small-scale “asset-light, service-heavy” PPP models, such as specialized services PPPs and integrated PPPs at the primary health care level may be suitable for selected projects for which the private sector has a competitive advantage.\n\nIn the long term, the government of Vietnam should reorient health PPPs toward equity and efficiency, two objectives of the national health system. All potential health care PPP projects should go through a rigorous screening process to ensure that they are suited to the universal health coverage goals and provide value for money (VfM) under this modality.\n\nThe definition of PPP in the legal framework should highlight the long-term nature of the contracts for service delivery, the importance of optimal sharing of risks and management responsibilities, and the key role of performance-linked payments in fostering effective PPPs. The scope of PPP contracts should not be limited to “build and operate/lease” infrastructure facilities but rather should be expanded to deliver high-quality public services to the population.\n\nThe PPP Investment Law should also allow ASAs to provide public financial support and establish mechanisms to calculate, account for, and monitor fiscal commitments.\n\nThe institutional arrangements for managing public-private engagements and partnerships in the health sector should be reinforced. \n\nFurther development of the private sector and local capital markets would create more opportunities for the public sector to build effective and sustainable partnerships with the private sector through health care PPP projects.",

      "Document Title": "Revitalizing Vanilla in Uganda: A Case Study Analysis of CRS Vanilla Value Chain Programming in Uganda, 2015-2020",
      "Key Findings": "Production: The national plant inventory of vanilla doubled through project interventions: 200,000 new vines on 400 acres were distributed\nand planted, and 533 acres of existing vanilla plantations were rehabilitated.\nFarm Income: Average gross income from vanilla over a year period increased from US$100 at baseline to US$2,224. Removing the issue of theft, farmer incomes increase to over US$8,000.\nOrganization: CRS and project actors helped to strengthen the Rwenzori Farmers Cooperative Union (RFCU) governance and financial management systems and service delivery to members.\nDiversification: Both RFCU and primary cooperative societies are diversifying their farm plots beyond vanilla to include cacao, bananas, coffee, soy, chia and other products. Diversification is a risk mitigation strategy to smooth both cooperative and farmer incomes over the medium- to long-term.\nTrade Facilitation: CRS facilitated the relaunch of the Association of Vanilla Exporters of Uganda (VANEX), which is now influencing trade and\nthe public policy environment for vanilla on an ongoing basis.\nRegulation: CRS and project actors influenced the drafting of a national level Ministerial Policy Instrument for the vanilla sector at the country level, with official harvest campaign dates announced by the government for the first time. Based in the agriculture branch of the national government, a commissioner was named to coordinate all vanilla\npolicy-related activities at the national level.\nRegulation: CRS and project actors designed and influenced the implementation of a vanilla ordinance in the Kasese and Bundibugyo districts, using a public policy and law enforcement instrument to address early picking and theft.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Uganda needs to continue to increase its production of exportable, high-quality vanilla at a national level to further strengthen its position as a strong secondary source of vanilla on the global market after Madagascar. This is a five- to ten-year process, with much work left to be done among all actors on the value chain.\nDesign climate-smart production systems using diverse agroforestry systems as a foundation. Given the probable impacts of climate change\non vanilla in Uganda in the coming years, this component is paramount to a successful country level strategy. Vanilla farm landscapes should\ninclude appropriate tree-based agriculture services (shade, nitrogen fixing, fuel and fodder resources), soil conservation strategies that increase water retention and drainage, and intercropping strategies of other cash and food crops.\nSmallholder farmer organizations focusing on vanilla will need to be created or strengthened to further consolidate smallholder farmer position as relevant actors on the chain. The CRS experience in building economies of scale is that this process usually takes 7-10 years of accompanying farmer organizations to sufficient levels of maturity. CRS\nwill apply its existing set of tools to this challenge and develop more in the coming years.\nAdopt a spatial traceability platform for use among vanilla value chain actors to track product flow from farm to final retailer. CRS is currently looking at two different options and will soon select one to promote among vanilla value chain actors in Uganda.\nAdopt risk management strategies to protect farmers and other value chain actors in Uganda from price volatility. Given the potential of vanilla\nactors to work together toward common goals, a fair price scheme could be developed and adhered to based on living income data and costs of production.\nHarmonize a performance measurement system to track the social, environmental and economic indicators relevant to all actors on the chain. These could include data on yield per plant, production costs, weather patterns, reforestation, employment and aggregated data on vanilla production volume by province.\nConvert VANEX into a sustainable, independent private sector association that governs the value chain and increases its competitiveness at the\nnational level.\nEnhance the reputation of Uganda vanilla on the global market. Launch a marketing campaign to promote Uganda vanilla as the world’s number one source of premium quality natural vanilla.\nContinue to advocate for a strengthened public policy framework to ensure a solid foundation for sector growth over the next decade.",

      "Document Title": "Understanding Private Sector Domestic Resource Mobilization for Health",
      "Key Findings": "1. Lotteries earmarked for health that the government runs, such as one in Costa Rica, earmark lottery revenues from individuals’ ticket purchases to a health program, such as one for immunization.\n2. Trust funds are private sector DRM for heath if the majority of funds that they mobilize come from the private sector, and they fund health programs. Examples include Bhutan’s Health Trust Fund, which mobilizes funds from several private sources in the country, such as private donations, salary deductions, and investment income. The government in Bhutan uses these revenues to fund health programs, including those for immunization (Thinley et al. 2017; Results for Development 2017).\n3. Taxes and levies earmarked for health that constitute private sector DRM include taxes such as an alcohol tax on households or a tax on private employers. An example is Guatemala’s alcohol tax that mobilizes funds for family planning commodities.\n4. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) for health includes contributions from companies to fund programs that aim to improve the health of employees, such as workplace wellness programs or company-run health clinics. Alternatively, CSR contributions may fund a local hospital or health program, benefiting the larger community.\n5. Lending mobilizes private sector funds by injecting private capital into a private health enterprise.\n6. Private capital investments constitute private sector DRM because they mobilize funds for health enterprises that aim to generate a financial return. An example includes investments in a health clinic. A less conventional example of private capital investment designed to generate funds for health comes from the Nam Theun 2 project in Laos in which a quasi-government entity (that mobilized public, private, and development partner funds) invested in a hydroelectric plant. The government of Laos reinvests revenue from the plant in health and development programs (Nakhimovsky et al. 2014).\n7. Health insurance contributions from households or individuals and private employers in the form of pre-payments (premiums) are forms of private sector DRM for health. Households can fund contributions from current earnings, savings, loans, or remittances. Private health insurance and government-sponsored health insurance schemes (where the government typically subsidizes and manages the scheme) both mobilize private sector funds for health.\n8. Out-of-pocket payments are “direct payments made by individuals to health care providers at the time of service use” (WHO, n.d.). Individuals can fund these payments from current earnings, savings, loans, or remittances. OOP spending differs from pre-payments, such as premiums paid for health insurance, in that OOP payments cover all or a portion of an amount owed, made when an individual uses a service. Examples of OOP spending include direct payment of fees by an individual to a provider, or cost sharing in the form of copayments, deductibles, or coinsurance, paid by individuals when they use services.\n9. Philanthropy for health includes contributions from individuals, philanthropic arms of a private business (such as a company foundation), and charities (such as religious institutions).",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Assess the fit of a DRM strategy within a country’s context. Many of the examples of private sector DRM that the authors found are relatively untested. This should not discourage donors from exploring ways to support private sector DRM, but it highlights the need to assess a country’s context and which DRM options offer the best fit. At the same time, donors must gauge the feasibility of a private sector DRM strategy, including whether its potential scale, impact, and applicability to a particular health need make sense in a country. \n\n2. Encourage resource mobilization strategies that support collaboration between the public and private sectors. When considering the potential scale and impact of private-to-private DRM strategies, the authors found that focusing on private-to-private DRM may exclude broader examples of resource mobilization that have the potential to raise funds for health (Box 4). There is potential in strategies such as consumption taxes, trust funds, and diaspora bonds that highlight how the public sector can facilitate the flow of private sector resources for health.\n\n3. Strengthen the enabling environment for private investment in private health. A favorable enabling environment can amplify efforts to mobilize private DRM for health. Donors can lend support at the systems level: helping to improve regulation, supervision, and quality assurance of private health service delivery; developing guidelines for private insurance products that complement public programs for low-income households; or investing in health information systems and digital technology.\n\n4. Consider catalytic investments in private sector DRM that will contribute to countries’ self-reliance. Donors should embrace their potential to support private sector DRM, especially through catalytic support such as technical assistance, risk mitigation, and matchmaking for investors and lenders. While private sector DRM that minimizes donor involvement may seem attractive for its apparent sustainability, solutions that mobilize catalytic support from donors may be more sustainable in the long term.",

      "Key Findings": "This research aims to provide evidence to help MNOs make informed\ndecisions about engaging in partnerships with humanitarian\norganisations, and to help humanitarian actors better understand\ntheir MNO partners and build successful long-term partnerships.\nThis report examines the motivations and benefits for MNOs to work\nin partnership with the humanitarian sector. In recent years, there has\nbeen much discussion about the value of such partnerships, primarily\nfrom the perspective of humanitarian organisations. This report aims to\ncomplement these discussions with the perspectives of MNOs.\n\nTo provide evidence of what successful partnerships might look like, this report features the experiences of four MNOs: Zain Cash (using\nbiometrics to deliver cash transfers in Iraq), Vodacom (supporting the responses to cyclones Ida and Kenneth in Mozambique), Jazz and Jazz\nCash (working with local development partners in Pakistan) and Jawwal and Paltel Group (providing services to humanitarians and citizens in successive crises in Palestine).\n\nZain Cash Success factors\n• Embedding innovative technologies to improve cash transfer process.\n• Implementing robust operating procedures to reduce potential complications from arising.\n\nVodacom Success factors\n• Leveraging technical expertise for quick, efficient restoration of mobile connectivity.\n• Providing real-time information to humanitarians.\n• Commercial incentives combined with innovative, flexible financing schemes to enable an agile response.\n\nJazz and Jazz Cash Success factors\n• Enabling innovative solutions that are applicable to the wider humanitarian sector.\n• Co-creating sustainable mobile-based solutions with and for affected populations.\n• Creating customised dashboards in line with donor requirements.\n\nJawwal and Paltel Group Success factors\n• Resilience and redundancy in their networks through robust continuity plans, investment and innovative tech.\n• Leveraging technical expertise for quick and efficient restoration of mobile connectivity.\n• Providing real-time information to humanitarians.\n• Cultivating long-term partnerships with a range of organisations. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "This report outlines four key features of successful partnerships that all parties should keep in mind:\n1. Identify shared value: structure partnerships so that they are beneficial for everyone.\n2. Align expectations: ensure that both sides align their expectations on what they are accountable for, and are clear and honest about the details of the project.\n3. Use shared language: eliminating jargon and sector-specific acronyms will make working relationships easier.\n4. Allow time: the strongest partnerships are those that are developed over time.",

      "Document Title": "Humanitarian Rental Market Interventions",
      "Key Findings": "• Rental housing occupies a grey area on the continuum between emergency and durable housing solutions, and between the shelter and housing sectors. It is therefore important that the wider rights- based concept of adequate housing is considered the benchmark in humanitarian rental market interventions.\n• Rental market interventions are a form of Market-based Programming (MBP) and should be designed, implemented and monitored following MBP best practices. This includes starting with a market analysis, and following the Minimum Standards for Market Analysis. In addition, an effective and appropriate rental market intervention is one that is founded on a context analysis and designed to address a range of barriers that displaced people face to access adequate housing.\n• Prioritise approaches that maximise the displaced households’ ability to make their choices independently (e.g. negotiating rent with landlords). Organisations should ensure that the criteria used to identify adequate rental housing are aligned with the target population’s priorities including location, cultural adequacy and cost.\n• The housing choices and preferences vary widely between men and women. It is important that the views of the different groups are captured in the decision-making process related to the selection of the properties. Attention should be given to the needs of persons with disability when identifying or upgrading properties. Integrated, multi-sectoral programmes which aim to make improvements to neighbourhoods have proven to be an effective way of addressing wider issues related to access to housing, when combined with household rental assistance.\n• Organisations should balance the need for certainty about property ownership with the need to provide humanitarian assistance, adopting an incremental approach to tenure security where necessary. Targeted support will likely be necessary to ensure that women and other vulnerable groups are not at increased risk of tenure insecurity. Trust – and proximity – between landlord and tenant can be a key factor in improving the latter’s tenure security. Written lease agreements usually help to improve tenure security. When used, a training for the two parties on the terms of the agreement is essential; including a third party in the rental contract is considered best practice.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Providing shelter solutions through rental market interventions is far more than just cash assistance: it requires a multisectoral response to address the social, physical, legal and financial barriers faced by households. This is particularly challenging in complex urban environments and given the complexity of rental markets. This report serves to present some broad learning from humanitarian organisations with experience of these, to help others navigate some of these issues. Many of the examples are, however, highly context-specific, and should be viewed in this light, and applied elsewhere with caution. Equally, organisations considering using rental market approaches should ensure that programmes are informed by a full understanding of the context and markets in which they are working.",

It presents challenges entrepreneurs face and the potential contribution of these in sectors that are central to the construction and sustainability of peace. It highlights the fact that their actions and capacity to offer jobs and revenue to the Yemeni population are constrained by the fragmentation of authority and the resultant lack of transparency. It also demonstrates that the focus on regional and international aid has left many entrepreneurs feeling abandoned and helpless.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Responding to the specific needs of the private sector is crucial and, by most standards, remains a daunting task. Yet, a number of concrete steps can be taken now to ensure some form of improvement and enhance the capacity of entrepreneurs to make positive contributions to society.\n\n-Establish a coordinating body between the private sector and CSOs: Civil society actors and the formal private sector should establish a nonpartisan coordinating body that would reduce barriers between them\n\n- Establish a network between the private sector, CSOs and local authorities\n\n- Encourage international actors to establish strategies and mechanisms enabling the private sector to support society\n\n-Engage in a defragmentation of institutions",

      "Document Title": "Mobile for Humanitarian Innovation",
      "Key Findings": "People affected by crisis continue to prioritize mobile technology not only as a means to communicate, seek and share information, but increasingly as a tool to access humanitarian assistance and become more financially resilient. It is vital that technology providers, humanitarian actors and MNOs protect client data, receive consent from clients and raise awareness of how their data is being used. A collaborative approach enables organizations to be more coordinated, to leverage strengths and to act with a shared vision. Given the multiple steps and requirements involved in delivering CVA successfully, for example, this approach may deliver greater benefits for all, particularly the recipients of humanitarian aid. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Whether humanitarian actors digitise their solutions or not, the individuals they serve are becoming more connected. A step-change is necessary to ensure that digital services are fit forpurpose and, most importantly, safe and secure. It is therefore critical that all actors operating in this space manage client data responsibly and ensure no one is left behind\n\nThere is still much to be done to ensure that local innovators can access and participate in funding mechanisms. Our hope is that they will not only be given funding to develop new ideas and prototypes, but also mentoring support and access to international support networks, which are not\navailable in all countries. Also, as more international NGOs launch in-house innovation accelerators, they should ensure that they engage, rather than\ndisplace, local actors.\n\nAdditionally, with GSMA member commitments to disclose climate impacts and energy and GHG emissions, we urge the humanitarian sector to consider sizing the climate the footprint of their digital services and determine whether these services are sustainable",

      "Document Title": "Barriers to Investing in Last-Mile Connectivity",
      "Key Findings": "To understand the barriers to investing in last-mile connectivity, it is important to first understand the typical investment process, regardless of sector. Investors prioritize investments based on risk factors and available mitigation strategies.\n\nInvestors often use a multi-step process to source and evaluate a potential investment. Each stage of the investment process introduces specific categories of risk. Investors work to identify these risks and develop pro-active risk mitigation strategies before, during, and after the investment transaction takes place. The investment process functions like a typical sales funnel. As a potential investment moves through the process, new categories of risk are identified and assessed with a decreasing number of potential transactions moving forward to the next stage of the investment process.\n\nInvesting in last mile connectivity requires investors to address four major barriers that emerge from the risk categories identified. In many ways, the operational complexity and commercial viability of operating an ISP has improved considerably over the last decade. The expansion of new telecom infrastructure and deconsolidation of legacy infrastructure has provided new opportunities for ISPs of various sizes to expand and thrive in previously unavailable market segments. \n\nHowever, our interviews indicated that investors are still reluctant to invest in last-mile connectivity transactions. After completing the interviews, our team analyzed the findings to identify key takeaways and recurring themes across the range of Investors interviewed. \n\nInvestors prioritize the potential upside vs downside of an investment based on risk factors and available mitigation strategies. Using the framework of risk categorization across sectors, this research sought to identify specific barriers within each risk category. The section below explains each of these barriers in detail and seeks to describe the challenges Investors face in making investments in last-mile connectivity companies.\n\nThe four barriers to investing are summarized below.\n1. Last-mile connectivity is a challenging sector with multiple external dependencies.\n2. The majority of last-mile connectivity companies struggle to secure investment due to their company growth stage.\n3. Investor economics and return expectations often don’t align with available ISP potential transactions.\n4. Regulatory uncertainty and ineffectiveness often add significant complexity to any potential transaction.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Barrier 1, Sector Risk: Last-mile connectivity is a challenging sector with multiple external dependencies:\n- Short-term: Encourage knowledge sharing of business models, with specific focus on deployment model, customer segmentation, and revenue models.\n- Mid-term: Advance benchmarking and information sharing of Investor metrics\n- Long-term: Financing middle mile that enables last mile and overall sector attractiveness \n\nBarrier 2, Execution Risk: The majority of last-mile connectivity companies struggle to secure investment due to their company growth stage.\n- Short-term: Develop open-source Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to provide low-touch productized technical assistance at scale.\n- Mid-term: Support targeted TA for Investment Readiness of ISPs, emphasizing investor need for a track record of performance packaged in a way that speaks to their investment criteria; Advisory and market intelligence TA support for Investors, to help reduce risk misconceptions\n- Long-term: Encourage experimentation but elevate what’s working at scale\n\nBarrier 3, Financing Risk: Investor economics and return expectations often don’t align with available Internet Service Provider (ISP) potential transactions.\n- Short-term: Support blended finance to reach missing middle growth stage ISPs\n- Mid-term: Develop currency risk-mitigation structures to unlock and leverage significant pools of private yield-minded infrastructure capital.\n- Long-term: Adapt known financing products and structures to LMC that can reduce cost of capital, risk perception, and standardize transaction process\n\nBarrier 4, Regulatory Risk: Regulatory uncertainty and ineffectiveness often add complexity to any potential transaction.\n- Short-term: Promote transparency of regulations and all sizes and types of LMC providers. \n- Mid-term: Facilitate enabling infrastructure including data centers, Internet exchange points, local hosted content, etc. \n- Long-term: Encourage harmonization of regulatory framework across economic regions.",

      "Document Title": "The Localization of Emergency Relief goodsReusable sanitary pads and soap in Vanuatu",
      "Key Findings": "1. It is time to redefine traditional emergency procurement.\nWith an increasing frequency of disasters and reduced certainty in access to global markets, the Government of Vanuatu and various donor agencies are looking to increase stockpiles of emergency relief goods in Vanuatu. There is an opportunity to build on this momentum and design strategies to better integrate localized procurement into a traditional emergency response. \n2. Localized procurement can maximize the benefits of emergency relief. The localized procurement of reusable sanitary pads and soap can boost local industry and increase economic opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises. It can enable increased employment for predominately female industries and would facilitate a new market outlet that will help stabilize production and foster new revenue avenues. \n3. Locally produced reusable sanitary pads are a valuable addition into hygiene and dignity kits.Reusable sanitary pads are a contextually appropriate, sustainable, economical and environmentally-friendly alternative to the traditional distribution of disposable sanitary pads. To ensure that the product is best-utilised, there is a need to include supporting materials into distributed kits and design complementary distribution procedures that provide relevant information and training. \n4. With a little guidance, the Vanuatu soap industry could produce a viable alternative to imported products. The production of soap in Vanuatu is a growing industry that can provide increased economic opportunities to producers and their local suppliers. National specifications for soap still need to be formalized before there can be a clear validation of its appropriateness. Shared learning, research or training may assist producers to design a product that will meet national and donor expectations. \n5. Local substitutions will not be price competitive with international alternatives. While there are some opportunities to reduce production costs for both MHM products and soap in Vanuatu, it is unlikely that the locally produced goods will be economically competitive with those available through global procurement catalogues. The substitution of a local alternative will require donors to access their value for money not just through a direct price comparison of products, but through a social and environmental lens that accounts for the complimentary positive impacts for the community and local economy. \n6. Locally made reusable sanitary pads and soap will need to be prepositioned. \nWith limited access to bulk materials and a lengthy production time, local businesses will not have the capacity to produce the high volume of goods on-demand within the expected timeframe for emergency distribution. The inclusion of locally made sanitary pads and soap into emergency distribution kits will require allocated funds to prepare prepositioned stockpiles of goods. \n7. Locally produced kits will not always be able to fill the demand.Given the high volumes of kits typically required in an emergency, it is unlikely that localized procurement will be able to fill the total demand. Strategies should instead focus on key kits or items and aim to cover a percentage of total NFI requirements with locally procured goods. \n8. Increased localization of NFIs builds the local economy and Vanuatu’s resilience to disasters.Defining the required items and their specifications in national guidelines will enable local businesses to source and supply required products and overtime could see growth in the range of products that can be sourced locally. The increased capacity to produce, procure, prepare and store emergency relief items in-country can ensure that kits are relevant and appropriate for the context and provides a safety net should international stocks be inaccessible. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "\n1. Advocate for collaborative working groups to formalize cluster guidelines on NFIs. Promote the establishment of a collaborative working group to define the contents of hygiene and dignity kits and formalize standards in national cluster guidelines. Review the possibility of a new MHM specific kit and identify which cluster this would fall under. \n2. Formalise a ‘Local Procurement Platform’ that links relevant businesses with donor agencies and facilitates the sharing of procurement requirements. Engage the Vanuatu Business Resilience Network (VBRN) to build on the existing framework that outlines localized sources for emergency items and facilitate a two-way dialogue between business houses and donor agencies. \n3. Share learnings with the NDMO and relevant clusters to facilitate the design of a national localization procurement policy. Support the design of a formalized tender process and comprehensive localization strategy for the procurement of emergency relief goods. Develop a long-term plan and aligning targets for the percentage of coverage of locally procured goods in an emergency response. \n4. Work with donor agencies to conduct a pre-assessment of locally procured items to confirm quality and suitability. \nBring together core donor agencies and INGOs to design a preassessment process that would validate the inclusion of locally made goods into existing kits or procurement strategies. Assess the quality of goods in-line with donor and cluster guidelines and where required conduct additional analysis or research into the suitability of the product. \n5. Identify opportunities to fund a pilot project to preposition locally made NFIs. Collaborate with traditional donors of prepositioned emergency relief stock, such as CERF, DFAT and MFAT, to design a pilot project that would trial the local production of complete or partial hygiene, dignity and MHM kits. \n6. Promote the design and distribution of an MHM kit that is sourced primarily in Vanuatu.  Develop a comprehensive MHM kit that will meet the requirements of girls and women in an emergency context in Vanuatu. Work with relevant clusters, government departments, INGOs and donor agencies to confirm contents and aim where possible to source goods from local suppliers. \n7. Identify technologies, ingredients or knowledge sharing that could support Vanuatu soap producers to meet Cluster and donor standards. Identify research and knowledge sharing opportunities that could support soap producers to align products with industry/national/ donor standards. Host a workshop with both formal and informal soap producers to share learnings, increase production capacity and establish linkages with potential markets. \n8. Investigate opportunities to reduce production costs for local producers.Explore opportunities or linkages with Pacific RISE for the mobilization of stock for reusable sanitary pads at Pacific hubs. Investigate a model for the consolidation of procurement of local materials to reduce production costs for soap producers. \n9. Define and promote best-practice for distribution of MHM products. Work with relevant clusters and distribution agencies to define and promote the best practice for the distribution of MHM materials during an emergency. This should include the provision of awareness and product demonstrations by female staff during distributions.",

      "Document Title": "Does Private Aid Follow the Flag? An Empirical Analysis of Humanitarian Assistance",
      "Key Findings": "The empirical results from studying humanitarian aid giving from 2000-2016 dash hopes that independent and more need-oriented aid giving from private actors will solve gaps in humanitarian aid. First, our results show that the allocation of private aid indeed follows the aid allocation of the respective official donor, i.e., lacks independence from official aid decisions. This finding is robust against the inclusion of various fixed effects, estimating instrumental variables models, and analyzing food and health aid separately. This pattern can be observed for both NGOs and corporate donors alike. Considering that previous research found geographic clustering among official donors (e.g., Aldasoro et al. 2010; Davies and Klasen 2019), our findings suggest that private donors are not very likely to change the existing reality of donor darlings and orphans. Second, we also find that the need orientation of private donors is not larger than that of official donors. In particular, it is worrisome that corporate private donors lack poverty orientation in their aid allocation given that poor countries typically require more\n30\nresources to overcome humanitarian crises. Moreover, the results do not suggest that private donors are more inclined to work in difficult institutional environments where corruption is high when compared to official donors. These results on aid allocation decisions are disappointing from a humanitarian perspective.\nAt the same time, some observations provide reasons for more optimism. First, our analysis reveals a large heterogeneity across donor countries with respect to whether private donors “follow the flag.” More precisely, we find that the aid allocations of private donors of eight out of 23 donor countries are statistically significantly aligned to the aid allocations of their governments. However, only in the case of China, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States can we interpret our findings as evidence for “following the flag.” Although, this is consequential since the United Kingdom and the United States are the most important contributors of private aid, this finding also suggests that government dependence is not necessarily inherent in private aid giving. Measures should be taken to reduce government influence in private aid giving. Second, it is encouraging that, in contrast to official aid, private humanitarian aid does not appear to be swayed by political distance, as we find no statistically significant relationship between private aid allocations and countries’ voting behavior in the United Nations.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Our results speak only indirectly to the question of whether private aid is more or less effective in alleviating humanitarian crises. Given that private aid follows official aid and that it does not appear to be systematically more responsive to need indicators, our study provides few reasons to believe that private aid outperforms official aid. Nevertheless, future research should devote more attention to this question. Another natural next step would be to broaden our analysis beyond humanitarian assistance to cover all types of private aid. This will require the need for the challenging but important task to construct a comprehensive multi-donor country multi-recipient country panel database on private aid giving. Finally, while our paper shows that private donors “follow the flag,” we cannot say anything about the relative importance of the several suggested mechanisms throughout our paper. For example, we cannot conclude whether the close alignment of private and official flows is mainly the outcome of government coercion and anticipatory obedience, or whether private donors may just want to benefit from complementarities to reduce costs. Future research should make use of micro data to shed more\n31\nlight on the relative importance of these drivers of why NGOs and corporations “follow the flag.”",

      "Key Findings": "Throughout its work and in particular through its adoption of the Market Systems approach, ARDS identified and piloted systemic solutions\nto address major market system constraints in the Ukrainian agricultural sector. Having measured the effectiveness of implemented solutions, ARDS developed a Behavior Change Communications Strategy to further scale up initiatives that demonstrated potential to change system actors’ behavior and developed a primary message for each intervention and targeted audience. ARDS summarized behavior change results to high light outcomes, contributing factors, sources of evidence, and challenges, which proved effective and ensured consistency in\ndelivering the right messages to target audiences.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the limited resilience of Ukraine’s agri-food sector, emphasizing the need for structural change\nto allow more efficient use of resources,to diversify production and sales, to add value, to continue efforts to organize the private sector\nto more effectively represent its interests, and for government to further adapt to a market economy in which government sets and enforces\nrules and regulations but does not normally itself play a major role in production and distribution. In other words, ARDS’ market systems approach and behavior change solutions are more important and relevant than ever for Ukraine.",
      "Key Recommendations": "As detailed throughout this report, flexibility, responsiveness, innovation, and adaptation proved to be key to ARDS success. Willingness and ability to take risks, try innovative approaches, and truly take in learning significantly enhanced ARDS’ impact, and became even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine. A quick pivot to online activities actually expanded ARDS’reach,allowing more people and from a broader geographical area to be included in events than would have\nbeen possible with traditional conferences or demonstrations. USAID particularly praised ARDS for its swift reaction and effective adjustment during and after the quarantine.",

      "Document Title": "TRANSFORMING FRUIT PRODUCTION IN MANICA PROVINCE, MOZAMBIQUE Case study of the emerging transformational impact\nof AgDevCo’s investment in Westfalia Fruto",
      "Document Summary": "This case study examines AgDevCo’s investments in Mozambique to connect local agricultural producers to export markets. It does this by working with Westfalia Fruto, a Mozambican subsidiary of a leading multinational supplier of fresh fruit to international markets. Its hope is to stimulate the local economy by employing women, increasing national income, and creating full-time equivalent jobs. The case study found signs of community uplift that include: increased spending in local communities, new economic actors and employment opportunities, formalization of production and employment, and financial inclusion.  These signs are pointing towards transformal change in Mozambique. ",
      "Key Findings": "In addition to catalysing transformational change in the fruit sector in Mozambique, Westfalia’s experiences in establishing\ncommercial export operations provide some other interesting lessons:\n1) Providing access to export markets can result in significantly greater incomes for fresh fruit producers such as litchi and avocado growers, even without accompanying investments in processing or value addition. Access to export markets does not however provide greater price stability that local markets - and perhaps even less.\n2) There are strong demonstration effects when working with emerging farmers, especially when producers are organised in an association. In the case of Westfalia, only 4 farmers initially sold litchi through Westfalia, while now over 200 are on track to start producing commercial grade litchi in the next few years. However, women are less likely to benefit as they tend to have access to less land and capital.\n3) Meeting international certification standards is difficult, but not impossible for emerging farmers. Meeting GlobalGap standards has required training and investment from both Westfalia and GIZ, but given that meeting the standards for one crop helps with certification for other crops, has the potential to help farmers diversify and hence reduce dependence on a single crop. Meeting these standards has also assisted in formalising labour practices and implementing basic health and safety guidelines, contributing towards SDG 8.\n4) Transformational change is not only about production and financial transactions but requires behaviour change in a number of areas, for example new production techniques including adherence to global standards for export markets, business management skills, and shifts in attitudes towards traditional gender roles. While these are all catalysed by commercial investment and soft finance other aspects may require partnerships with non-commercial actors (e.g. GIZ).\n\n5) Transformational change does not always come from smallholder farmers: in this case Westfalia is working with larger, emerging farmers who work with more land and so are able to generate indirect job creation and have greater purchasing power. This in turn drives additional community uplift spillovers. This demonstrates the importance of taking a holistic view of impact, as only focusing on the direct beneficiaries (emerging farmers) can mask the true transformational change taking place.",

      "Document Title": "The Effects of Organizational Traits on NGO–Business Engagement in Mexico",
      "Key Findings": "The main findings show that likelihood of NGO engagement with firms is correlated with making corporate donations deductible for businesses, NGO size and scope, activities and level of professionalization, sustaining broader stakeholder relations, and showing transparency about the mission and goals of the NGO. The paper includes an analysis of the determinants of specific forms of engagement and discusses some implications for NGO–business engagement and its support of the SDG targets. \nData indicated that:\n-Mexican NGOs are relatively small, with an average of 5.1 employees for environmental NGOs and 4.3 employees for social NGOs, with frequency distributions that are positively skewed, based on our sample. Thus, for most of them, sustaining an on-going relationship with the private sector is hampered by their small size. Larger NGOs, which have more employees and more volunteers, are better equipped and more likely to sustain engagement with firms because they have more capacity to manage multiple relationships and fulfill requirements\n-Regarding those NGOs that have sustained relations with the private sector in the past five years, our results confirm that NGOs are motivated to engage with firms because of the possibilities of acquiring additional resources, thus increasing the capacity to fulfill their mission and achieve their goals\n- Lastly, we found that even if NGOs are more likely to engage with businesses because of their ability to influence public policy and mobilize consumers, in reality the majority of engagements take the form of joint projects, followed by volunteering opportunities. Participation with companies in government forums and fundraising appeared in third and fourth place, respectively, followed by providing consulting services, designing CSR programs for companies, and collaborating with firms in the design of public policies. This shows that the majority of NGOs in countries like Mexico might prefer to concentrate in time-bound and activity-specific formats involving bilateral relationships, rather than engaging in more complex policy and campaigning processes that could position firms negatively in the eyes of the government or other stakeholders",
      "Key Recommendations": "Better understanding of the mechanisms behind partnership design and implementation, as well as their outcomes and impacts, is central to ensuring that engagements of all forms and sizes—bilateral, trilateral, multi-stakeholder, and covering the full spectrum of business activity—are effectively serving to change or improve current conditions. Of particular importance in this regard would be to look more closely at what partnerships “do” in terms of sharing knowledge and expertise and mobilizing resources in order to achieve the SDGs.",

      "Document Title": "PRIVATE SECTOR LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT U.S. COMPANIES IN COLOMBIA",
      "Document Summary": "This analysis looks at how USAID/Colombia has engaged with the private sector under its Country Development Cooperation Strategy program, which works to engage the private sector in sustainability. The document examines many companies to learn about working conditions and social investment strategies of US companies in Columbia to understand the relationships between the companies from a financial perspective. The document is guided by two main questions, “How was the financial performance of U.S companies operating in Colombia between 2014 and 2018?” and “How did U.S companies operating in Columbia perform on social investment and sustainability in 2019?”  It then gives recommendations, conclusions, and key findings regarding the key questions. ",
      "Key Findings": "1. According to Colombia’s Banco de la República, for the years 2007-2018, the country that generated the greatest inflows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Colombia was the U.S. (USD $28.208 billion).\n2. The inflows coming from the U.S. represented 19 percent of the total of FDI inflows to Colombia during this same period. However, the inflows coming from the U.S. have had a downward trend. In 2007 they were 30 percent, and in 2018, 23 percent. The reason behind it is the growth of\nFDI in Colombia.\n3. The amount of FDI inflows to Colombia for the years 2007- 2018 has fluctuated between USD $2 billion and USD $2.9 billion, except for the year 2010 when it plummeted to USD $1.592 billion.\n4. As of the year 2018, at least 328 U.S. companies were operating in Colombia. From these, 254 companies are foreign companies, and the remaining 74 operate in the country as different legal entities.\n5. According to a report published by Semana magazine in 2019, 102 of the 1,000 largest companies in Colombia are U.S. companies.\n6. Between 2014 and 2018, the number of SMEs increased rapidly in the country. These organizations are operating in various sectors of the economy, leading to a diversification of U.S. industrial activities in Colombia.\n7. The participation of U.S. companies in the Colombian economy has mostly concentrated in five sectors: the extractive industry, commerce and reparation of vehicles or motorcycles, manufacturing, information and\ncommunication, and professional, scientific, and technical activities. By 2018, the mining and energy, commerce, and manufacturing sectors represented more than 80 percent of capital inflows.\n8. Between 2014 and 2018, U.S. companies operating in Colombia greatly improved their financial performance (assets, equity, and earnings). According to a survey of 45 U.S. companies operating in the country, 62 percent of them believe that their operations have grown during the\nlast four years.\n9. The extractive and commerce industries represent more than 65 percent of the total assets owned by U.S. companies between 2014-2018.\n10. According to information published by the RUES (Unified Commercial and Social Registry), 80 percent of U.S. companies registered in Colombia reported having 49,237 permanent employees in 2018. However, in a report published by the U.S Bureau of Economic Analysis – BEA, that number doubles. The BEA reported that in 2018, international U.S. companies created more than 86,000 jobs in Colombia. The highest number of jobs in 2018 were created by the manufacturing industry (29 percent).\n11. This analysis found significant differences in the methods the 328 U.S. companies operating in Colombia use to apply sustainability indicators. For example, while 67 percent of the largest companies published sustainability reports, only nine percent reported this information in Colombia. In the case of small and medium-sized companies, only 16 percent published sustainability reports, and only two percent did so in\nColombia.\n12. According to the Private Sector Social Investment Index (IISP) of 2020, the largest 26 U.S. companies contributed USD $46.3 million in voluntary social investments in Colombia during 2019.\n13. According to a survey to foreign branches, all of the 45 U.S. SME companies invested USD $10.7 million in social projects.\n14. According to the IISP Index, the social projects implemented by U.S. companies focused on three main areas of development: rural (41 percent), socioeconomic (24 percent), and health (17 percent). In terms of demographics, the U.S. companies focused their social investment resources primarily on children, teenagers, and young adults (52 percent).\n15. These U.S. companies also reported that, in 2019, they invested USD $14 million in environmental factors: USD $11 million were voluntary investments, USD $2.5 million were mandatory investments, and USD $0.8 million were compensations.\n16. When comparing the average performance of 26 U.S. companies to the 102 companies participating in the IISP, the PSLA Team sees an opportunity to enhance the management of their social investment. The score of U.S. companies in the various aspects evaluated by the IISP index was below average.\n17. Only 19 percent of the 26 largest U.S. companies did social investments in PDET municipalities (Development Programs with a Territorial Focus). These investments are aligned with four of the eight pillars established by the national government: economic reactivation and agricultural production (32 percent), rural housing, drinking water and\nearly childhood care (22 percent), rural education and early childhood care (20 percent), and infrastructure and land use (19 percent). 18. The survey the PSLA Team conducted revealed that most of the 45 U.S. SMEs operating in Colombia agree social investments carried out by their companies had a positive impact on communities (56 percent), their companies have an established sustainability strategy (53 percent), and their social investments are aligned with the country's development agenda (49 percent). The survey also found some companies consider their investments are unrecognized (29 percent), that resources allocated to social actions are not proportional to the profits of the company (36 percent), and that social investments aren't a priority for their businesses (40 percent).\n19. One of the primary reasons U.S. SMEs do not establish international cooperation agreements is their perception international cooperation agencies do not have suitable work mechanisms. Some of the highlighted reasons are disparities in work agendas (16 percent), a high complexity on cooperation agreement processes (13 percent), operating processes of partner organizations are slow and not efficient (nine percent), and inconsistency in geographical focus (seven percent). The above reasons comprise 45 percent of the total results.\n20. Regarding the expectations of foreign companies on the roles of the U.S. Embassy and USAID/Colombia, the PSLA collected results demonstrating that companies are interested in establishing agreements and creating alliances with these two entities. However, these companies ignore the reach and the opportunities available to create joint work agendas between the U.S. Embassy, USAID, and the private sector.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. The U.S. Embassy's Economic Section in Colombia and USAID/Colombia should consider creating an investment strategy that has a clear focus on new industries, as well as small and medium-sized enterprises. The current approach towards existing industries should also be evaluated. This can be done by studying, for example, potential\ncooperation models with companies in the mining and energy industries.\n2. The U.S. Embassy's Economic Section should continue implementing\nstrategies to promote U.S. investment in Colombia's industries, because Colombia generates a growing number of opportunities. Additionally, the national government has been implementing tax measures that benefit the foreign industries, such as the Financing Law. Finally, Colombia's strategic geographic location is viewed as attractive by new investors.\n3. USAID/Colombia should consider working on creating a strategy to\nsupport U.S. companies facing these three important challenges: spreading local supply strategies, building a closer relationship between its social investments and strategies implemented by other participants in\nthe same territories, and prioritizing their sustainability strategies across\ntheir organizations, so stakeholders recognize them as sustainable\nbusinesses.\n4.  The Mission should consider creating an active networking agenda with both the Colombian government and the private sector, to combine efforts in fostering social investments in PDET municipalities.\n5. The Mission could consider designing a strategy that contributes to a better promotion of the investments executed by U.S. companies in\nColombia, in order to improve their recognition among the various\nstakeholders.\n6. It is necessary and a strategic opportunity that USAID/Colombia\nMission develop an intensive process of dialogue with companies,\norganizations, and implementing partners regarding the contributions,\nchallenges, and gaps of social investment of U.S. companies in\nColombia.\n7. USAID/Colombia should design a protocol or communication strategy\noriented to informing companies about common strategic areas of\ninterest in the country and the procedures required to work jointly with the Mission in the development of social projects. It is important to\ncreate a positive story and reduce the high levels of unawareness of the\nMission in Colombia development.",

      "Key Findings": "Findings indicated that when private sector engagement in humanitarian logistics, humanitarian financing and humanitarian technology was applied there was improvement in implement humanitarian aid projects during disasters. There was more access to relief good, better transportation, agility, preparedness, solutions to insufficient funds through diversification, funding strategies and the relief funds were also more accessible to organizations in disaster relief. Further humanitarian innovation, utilization of communication technologies, digital fund mobilization and digital humanitarian response contributed to improved implementation of humanitarian aid projects. With this collaboration, it is possible to respond to sudden changes in need by persons in distress\nduring a disaster; and there are available written contingency plans and procedures to respond to disasters. Needless to say, over dependency on one donor leads to less humanitarian funding and private sector issue grants to humanitarian organizations for sudden on-set disasters. Also, raising humanitarian funds through mobile money has been a success; cash transfer through mobile money enable quicker access to relief aid.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The study made several recommendations as follows: engaging the private sector in a combination of fields to ensure effective response in onset of a disaster; creating a body of private sector companies engaging in humanitarian work. ",

In 2020, Nepal was ranked among the bottom 10 countries in this index, although this may change with further investment in hydropower. From a methodological point of view, a scenario analysis of various energy futures would also be a worthwhile follow-up approach.",

      "Key Findings": "A resilient health system can withstand everyday stressors and unexpected shocks to ensure the continuous provision of both routine and emergency health services during times of calm and crisis. This report sets forth a strategic approach that can guide USAID missions in scaling private sector engagement in health system resilience (HSR) efforts.\n\nWe live in a world of hazards that is placing increasing strain on national health systems worldwide. As USAID missions seek to support governments in preparing health systems and societies for these stressors and shocks, the strategic approach outlined in this report can assist in prioritizing the private sector’s involvement. A resilient health system is one that has successfully identified, engaged, and mobilized a diverse range of public and private partners unique to the context and the wide range of potential stressors and shocks we face. No government, international body, or private sector entity can effectively prepare for and respond to stressors and shock events alone. The whole community is needed.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This strategic approach emphasizes the need to build public-private joint preparedness efforts before shocks occur, to broker trust, conduct risk assessments and private ecosystem analyses, increase the number and improve the structure of partnerships for HSR, improve interagency coordination mechanisms, and develop dedicated financing to mobilize joint efforts. Depending on the type of stressor or shock event, this strategic approach can be applied in a flexible manner. In contexts where stressors have not yet led to health system collapse and where there is sufficient time to prepare for shock events before they occur, stakeholders would start at the outset of the approach, emphasizing early action to involve the private sector in broad preparedness planning. When shock events leave no time for preparedness planning (such as in the case of a natural disaster, fast moving epidemic, or violent event) stakeholders would emphasize the priorities in the latter portion of the strategic approach by encouraging rapid private sector engagement in the areas of prevention, detection, response, and recovery. This approach, regardless of the type of stressor or shock scenario, aims to tangibly help USAID missions, local governments, and international health system stakeholders systematically engage private sector actors in meeting health system resilience goals.\n\nStrategic Approach Before and Event Occurs:\n- Priority 1: Act early\n- Priority 2: Strengthen and prepare the health system by addressing stressors and planning for shocks\n- Priority 3: Invest in risk assessments and private sector analyses to inform HSR preparedness planning\n- Priority 4: Develop more partnerships using diverse private sector engagement methods",

      "Document Summary": "This document examines institutional innovations with the Green Climate Fund (GCF), an organization that finances climate mitigation in developing countries. The study lays the groundwork for a larger study that will look at the effect institutional innovations have on society. The innovations that the GCF implemented challenged the function of the fund. The article concludes that the GCF gives the Global South a greater voice and opportunity to grow through private-public partnerships. There has been tension with conflicting views on what the fund should do, since it is a new organization and there should be further research to study the contradictions that occurred. \n",
      "Key Findings": "The GCF is a new international organization with many institutional innovations. The GCF reflects a world in which the Global South has a stronger voice. The institution has learned from critiques such as undemocratic decision making, dominance of donors and lack of country ownership associated with the IMF and World Bank. The GCF is more democratic, and there is a parity between donors and recipient countries in decision making. Country ownership is highlighted, while voices from\ncivil societies are included systematically in the decision-making process and the monitoring of the secretariat. The GCF is more transparent than other institutions, with board meetings streamed live and documents available on the website. At the same time, the GCF has embraced the broad involvement of the private sector and has gone much further in this respect than other intergovernmental organizations. The GCF does not just systematically include the private sector in project design and implementation: it also sees the private sector as a partner to raise capital and generate profits. The GCF is thus much more than a climate agency but is deeply involved in developing economies in the Global South\nthrough public–private partnerships. As a result of the institutional innovations, there are substantial tensions between partly conflicting goals. Donor–recipient parity makes replenishment more difficult,\nwhile consensus orientation undermines ambitious spending goals. Transparency and civil society participation discourage private sector involvement, while the latter undermines the objective to channel half of the fund’s spending to climate adaptation projects.",

      "Key Findings": "Prominent findings from the evidence review:\n(a) The use of CVA modalities such as vouchers, or market support modalities such as social marketing for hygiene during emergencies or fragile contexts, can improve indicators of availability for hygiene items, such as vendors’ satisfaction and profit, as well as the quality of the hygiene products accessed by beneficiaries.\n(b) Market support modalities such as ‘supporting private or public water market’ actors during emergency preparedness or response phases can have a positive effect on water availability indicators, resulting in an improved capacity of local water market actors and infrastructure, such as water kiosks or water utilities.\n(c) CVA can have a positive effect on financial access to most WASH goods and services; beneficiaries effectively accessed water, latrine, and hygiene items through cash or voucher during emergencies.\n(d) Supporting market actors such as water utilities or hygiene vendors can improve physical access to WASH by improving availability of water and hygiene items near the beneficiaries, during and after emergencies.\n(e) Certain CVA modalities can have a positive effect on quality indicators for sanitation, such as vouchers or conditional instalments (tranche payments) for latrine construction in recovery phase, and vouchers for latrine desludging services",
      "Key Recommendations": "1) Prepare and pilot WASH interventions which include market-based modalities during the three first months of a response to a rapid onset emergency, monitor and evaluate results and produce lessons-learned documents to contribute to the evidence base.\n2) Conduct studies comparing the cost- efficiency of market-based modalities versus direct service delivery during emergencies.\n3) Conduct qualitative and rigorous research on WASH complementary programming to better understand the causal pathways that lead to these observed effects, and establish statistical correlation between modalities and observed effects. A priority would be to measure the added value of combining MPC with other WASH-specific modalities such asWASH-market support, labelled cash/vouchers/in-kind distribution for WASH items or services that are unlikely to be prioritized by beneficiaries or not included in the MEB (such as menstruation hygiene management items or latrine construction material and labour).\n4) Ensure more systematic monitoring of higher-level WASH outcomes (including quality and use) when using WASH market support modalities during emergencies.\n5) Advocate for a more systematic monitoring of higher-level WASH outcomes (quality, use) when using CVA modalities (including for MPC).\nEnsure that interventions that include multisector CVA modalities (including MPC) are appropriately designed to achieve and monitor WASH quality and use outcomes.\n6) Pilot interventions using sanitation market support modalities in humanitarian contexts, with a focus on preparedness and resilience (refer to the report on MBP for sanitation practices for examples, and details on feasibility), monitor and evaluate results and produce lessons-learned documents to contribute to the evidence base.\n7) Pilot interventions using HHWT market support modalities in humanitarian contexts, with a focus on preparedness and resilience (refer to report on MBP for water practices for examples of practices, and details on feasibility), monitor and evaluate results and produce lessons-learned documents to contribute to the evidence base.\n8) Conduct rigorous studies assessing the effect of market-based modalities for WASH (particularly market support) on health outcomes, as well as the causal pathways to achieving these outcomes.",

      "Document Title": "AgResults Impact Evaluation Report: Nigeria AflasafeTM Challenge Project FINAL",
      "Key Findings": "-Evaluation Question 1 (private sector involvement and market impact): The evaluation found that compared to the baseline, demand for AT/AC maize expanded among many market players that were reached by AgResults. By the end of project year 3, the supply of AT/AC maize increased, with more than 13,000 farmers producing 39,212 MT of AT/AC maize for sale through 24 competitors that marketed to a variety of multi-national, export, and domestic industry buyers. There was a large number of private sector actors that engaged smallholders by offering diverse incentives including access to markets, financing, and improved inputs.\n\n-Evaluation Questions 2, 3, and 4 (smallholder impacts):\nThe project expected to impact smallholder welfare along three key domains that we measured using three primary indicators: uptake of Aflasafe, net revenue from maize, and consumption of AT/AC maize. The AgResults Challenge Project had a positive and significant impact on all three primary outcomes (see Exhibit ES-6). \n\nThe evaluation found that the project had a positive impact on uptake of Aflasafe. Fifty-seven percent of smallholders in the treatment group applied Aflasafe on at least one plot, compared to only 1 percent in the comparison group. This implies an increase in uptake by 56 percentage points as a result of the project. \n\nThe project resulted in increasing smallholder income from maize. The evaluation found that smallholders in the treatment group earned US$318 (100,170 Naira) more than smallholders in the comparison group when taking into account the value of maize saved for consumption and the smallholders’ costs for all inputs for maize production. This is equivalent to a 16 percent increase as a proportion of their average annual income from maize. Among smallholders who adopted Aflasafe on at least one plot, the impact on net income from maize was US$568 (178,920 Naira). Therefore, we conclude that smallholders benefitted economically from the project.\n\nThe project had a positive and significant impact on consumption of AT/AC maize. The project was expected to increase smallholder farmers’ consumption of AT/AC maize by virtue of own consumption. Based on responses from cooks in the household, we found that smallholder households in the treatment group reported consuming 0.02 kg more Aflasafe- treated maize the previous day than the comparison group. For smallholders who adopted Aflasafe the impact was 0.04 kg. Given that an average person consumed 0.17 kg of maize per day, this implied 13 percent more consumption of AT/AC maize the previous day (see\nExhibit ES-6).\n\n-Evaluation Question 5 (sustainability). The evaluation found that the project created a niche market for AT/AC maize. Both competitors and smallholders benefitted economically from engaging in the market for AT/AC maize by accessing markets such as maize exporters, supermarkets, and the poultry feed markets, which paid a premium over average maize prices. However, this was sometimes a consequence of better quality rather than solely Aflasafe treatment. To the extent that the competitors and smallholders continue to access these premium markets, they expect to engage in the AT/AC maize market.\n\n-Evaluation Question 6 (scale and cost-effectiveness). The project’s business plan hoped that private sector investment in distribution and increase in uptake of Aflasafe by smallholders would lead to 3 percent market penetration of AT/AC maize in all of Nigeria.\n\n1. The supply of AT/AC maize increased, with more than 13,000 farmers producing 39,212 MT of AT/AC maize for sale through 24 competitors that marketed to a variety of multi-national,\nexport, and domestic industry buyers.\n2. Fifty-seven percent of smallholders in the treatment group applied Aflasafe on at least one plot, compared to only 1 percent in the comparison group implying an increase in uptake by 56 percentage points as a result of the project. \n3. smallholder households in the treatment group reported consuming 0.02 kg more Aflasafe-treated maize the previous day than the comparison group \n4. Both competitors and smallholders benefitted economically\nfrom engaging in the market for AT/AC maize by accessing markets such as maize exporters, supermarkets, and the poultry feed markets, which paid a premium over average maize prices. \n5. Private sector investment in distribution and increase in uptake of Aflasafe by smallholders would lead to 3 percent market penetration of AT/AC maize in all of Nigeria.\n\n",

      "Document Title": "Renewable energy project implementation in Africa: Ensuring sustainability through community acceptability",
      "Key Findings": "- There is a sheer urgency to enhance procedures and practices identified within the implementation of renewable energy across local communities in Africa. By ensuring a careful and coordinated approach towards the social dynamics of communities, including a wide variety of stakeholders and partners who will directly or indirectly be affected by a project, will have an impact on renewable energy success. The process will undoubtedly require a fundamental methodology on social acceptance, dependant on trust between project initiators and the community to advance thoughts and mutual respect for one another.\n\n- Our review also indicates the need to increase local and private sector participation in sustainable renewable energy services in Africa. \n\n- There is a need to survey the procedure on how national policies on energy can be converted into community projects through other elective methods to promote the sense of community ownership and sustainability. Perception may also influence the acceptance of renewable energy. With renewable energy technologies being relatively new in the African context, understanding psychological factors that interrelate and influence acceptance can enhance project design and implementation, for example, understanding how a technology works and its impacts, may shape the cost-benefit perception of consumers. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "- We recommend amongst the following that, a bottom-up approach that allows local people to be primary actors from project initiation to monitoring and evaluation is a prerequisite that should not be downplayed. By allowing communities to lead a project will bolster not only acceptability but also sustainability and a strong sense of ownership, which is crucial to project implementation success. \n\n- More so, we found out that quality standards, effective communication of policies, and skilled labour force, are prevalent challenges in the energy sector of many African countries. These challenges can be addressed through joint public education and decentralised training programmes for communities, to awaken their consciousness on policy initiatives and efforts by government. \n\n- Policy instruments and incentives like a tax credit, feed-in-tariffs, grants, power subsidies, and payback credits should therefore be encouraged. \n\n- Lastly, the cultural dynamics and reverence for traditional leadership, local traditions and community beliefs should be treated under the lens of respect to ensure that community ownership and acceptance is fully guaranteed. To a possible extent, identified cultural institutions’ or equivalent should be actively involved in project processes to ensure that no tradition, custom or rules are breached but fully integrated into project implementation.\n",

      "Document Title": "AgResults Evaluation: Zambia Biofortified Maize Challenge Project\nClose-Out Assessment",
      "Key Findings": "AgResults played a role in the development of a niche market for PVA\nmaize, although with limited development impact as it attracted more commercially oriented smallholder farmers and urban consumers, who were less likely to be nutritionally vulnerable. While AgResults played a clear role in developing this niche market, it is not possible to identify the magnitude of its effect relative to the complementary role played by ‘push’ initiatives that were operating at the same time. HarvestPlus, in particular, played a prominent role in introducing PVA maize to smallholder farmers and shares credit for the development of the market.\nOur research suggested that the market would be sustained in the\nshort to medium term, with private sector respondents describing their intent to continue in the market, their specific plans for doing so, and the ready demand for PVA maize. Nonetheless, our research also suggested that under current conditions, the market would continue to operate as a niche market only, i.e., we have not found an indication that the production and consumption of PVA maize will become mainstream. Thus, for this reason and for reasons discussed in our Abt Associates AgResults Close-Out Assessment Report – December 2020  Zambia Biofortified Maize Challenge Project lessons learned, PVA maize is unlikely to reach the most nutritionally vulnerable consumers that the project sought to benefit. Our inquiries showed that the market experienced a short-term disruption due to the challenge project’s early termination. Numerous respondents reported concern that AgResults’ early termination was indicative of waning donor interest in PVA maize. However, there was strong confidence about continued commitment to PVA maize by the Zambian government. Early termination of the challenge project did not appear to undermine support for the concept of a PfR scheme, largely because that concept was misunderstood in the Zambian context.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1) The solution to the targeted development problem should have the potential to directly and significantly impact the project’s intended beneficiaries.\n2) Challenge projects are most likely to succeed when the projects’ competitors can adequately alleviate the binding constraints limiting the market’s development.\n3) Competitors should see a long-term business case for the innovation and should have the numbers and capacity to form the foundation of a competitive market.\n4) The theory of change should articulate how the PfR scheme will induce competitors to address the market constraints limiting the development of a sustainable market and reach its potential beneficiaries.\n5) The project should seek to minimise trade-off between market impact and development impact by defining qualifying parameters for PfR awards that are linked as closely as possible to the project’s intended development objective.\n ",

      "Key Findings": "Major findings of the baseline are aligned with the needs assessment previously done for development of the program proposal, although additional details were learned during this process. Some priorities that had broad support among stakeholders relate to: (i) the need to standardize preliminary and rapid damage assessment tools; (ii) the need for increased automation, creating a unified and streamlined system for data gathering and data\nmanagement to support damage assessments; (iii) the need to improve interinstitutional coordination in field\noperations for post-disaster damage assessments for housing. These three specific needs will be directly addressed by the PREPARE Costa Rica program. The study also identified gaps and needs that most likely will be indirectly addressed with Activity 1 of the program, which intends to develop a Critical Path Analysis of the post-disaster damage assessment system for housing in Costa Rica.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The PREPARE Costa Rica program will address specific gaps and needs of the damage assessment system for housing identified in this baseline study. Other issues identified in this report, like the need for formal processes and protocols to recruit volunteers for post-disaster damage assessments, are out of the scope of this program. However, it is expected that the development of a Critical Path Analysis (Activity 1) will analyze this and other gaps in more detail, as an input for the development of a comprehensive roadmap for a post-disaster damage assessment system\nfor housing in Costa Rica.",

Efforts to prevent pregnancy among women who chose to delay or avoid pregnancy during the Zika outbreak required coordination, mobilization, and engagement among federal and territorial agencies, key stakeholders, and private-sector partners. The use of public–private partnerships was important to provide expertise, context, speed, support, and awareness for the Z-CAN program’s rapid development, implementation, and sustainability efforts. Strategies and lessons learned from the Z-CAN program’s public–private partnerships can serve as a model to other settings for which access to contraception could improve health outcomes.",

      "Key Findings": "- Knowing private providers’ service offerings, specialties, and locations is essential for effective public-private engagement. This information helps stakeholders build systems that routinely engage all health system entities.\n- The participation of a wide range of stakeholders throughout the data-generating process is instrumental in getting support across the board. It also eases the transition of databases to local ownership and increases the likelihood that the data is used.\n- Efforts to organize and strengthen the voice of the private sector need to go beyond the sector itself. If public stewards and regulators are engaged early on to help identify problems and solutions, they will be more likely to support the organizing effort and view the private sector organization as a legitimate partner for engagement. Private providers may see more value in participating in the organizing effort if the government is involved. \n- By narrowing the focus on a specific problem, opportunity, or geographic area, organizing efforts can dedicate sufficient time and resources to ensure the initial efforts are successful, thereby creating momentum for broader engagement down the line. Once success is proven, organizing efforts can more effectively expand the geographic scale of membership and the technical scope of activities.\n- Building the capacity of the public sector to engage with the private sector requires more than just training stakeholders. Pairing trainings with user-friendly tools, processes, and systems can reduce barriers within the public sector and motivate public stewards to use their new skills.\n- Embedding long-term advisors within key public sector agencies can help promote public sector staff to take up new tools, troubleshoot questions, and better understand opportunities, leading to more successfully operationalized partnerships.\n- Long-term, sustained successful engagement requires going beyond ad hoc, opportunity-driven partnership efforts. It needs a systematic, evidence-based approach that can help stakeholders comprehensively evaluate opportunities with the greatest potential for success. \n- A systematic consensus-building strategy is important to build trust in the partnership and convince stakeholders of the benefits of the engagement. Starting off with individual meetings with stakeholders before bringing everyone together can ensure all voices are heard and help smooth the road to implementation. \n- Recognizing and articulating the value of the engagement to private providers is essential for sustaining the engagement effort. Community recognition and public health contribution can be strong motivating factors for private providers.\n- User-friendly tools and processes encourage continued participation of busy private providers and are important for sustaining the engagement effort.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Support the generation of high-quality reliable data to help the government understand the scope and scale of the private health sector.\n- Facilitate an inclusive and participatory dialogue, especially where collaboration has been absent.\n- Equip the public sector with the necessary skills and understanding of why and how to engage with the private health sector.\n- Consider phased approaches to achieve quick results and generate momentum.",

      "Document Summary": "The document “Lessons Engaging the Private Sector In Sustainable Practices in Latin America,” examines three USAID environment activities in Paraguay and Colombia. The activities are said to engage with the private sector and break barriers to create sustainability within the cattle supply chain in Latin America. The private sector worked with conservation groups in order to examine and practice sustainable cattle practices like providing environmentally friendly menus in restaurants that provide beef and dairy products. The document provides lessons learned that include: USAID’s role to act as a promoter, building and maintaining trust, building sustainable practices across the value chain, and building a communication strategy to reach multiple audiences. ",
      "Key Findings": "1) USAID’s role is to act as a promoter or as a convenor, but not as a\nprotagonist. The deliberate centering of local leadership helps sustain work after USAID leaves.\n2) Building and maintaining trust requires taking the time to agree upon shared language and circling back periodically to revisit the language, adjust as needed, and recommit.\n3) Gaining scale requires demonstrating the effectiveness of the model in\nmultiple ways and using a deliberate communication strategy to reach multiple audiences.\n4) Building connections and a shared understanding of sustainable practices across the value chain is key, as ultimately, sustainable production practices depend upon reliable consumers. However, the public sector has a key role to play by creating an enabling policy environment and supporting data collection to build a credible evidence base.",

      "Key Findings": "Hence, this paper aims to investigate the main barriers to diffusing photovoltaics for residential buildings from the public sector, private sector, and the people’s perspectives in Norway. Furthermore, it analyzes solar development, policies, and models in different countries, and proposes a potential model and solutions to overcome barriers. The results show that the high initial costs of photovoltaics and limited information and awareness of the possible benefits are the main barriers for the people. For the private sector, limited funding and few pilot projects to learn from, as well as risk uncertainty are the main barriers. The main concern in the public sector is the low application of existing incentives. Public-private-people partnerships (PPPP) have a big potential to overcome these barriers by dividing the high initial costs into more affordable sums, facilitating the information flow among different sectors, and involving all three sectors to create new incentives. In addition, Norway is well-suited for PPPP, as the citizens pay much attention to sustainable development, and there is already a close collaboration between the public and private sectors in the energy sector. Finally, three concrete solutions using PPPP are proposed: design a co-investment solution, provide information sharing platforms, and create new incentives.",
      "Key Recommendations": "There are currently limited existing resources on solar PV projects, barriers for the diffusion of solar PV, as well as analyses of partnerships for diffusing solar PV in Norway, which may lead to a biased result. Furthermore, while the application of PPPP has been proven to have the potential to make use of more resources, achieve good information sharing and solve the high initial cost problems, there are few real case studies, and its efficiency needs to be further verified.",

      "Key Findings": "Contributions of international humanitarian assistance from private donors grew by 9% to US$6.8 billion in 2019, driven by an increase in funding from private individuals. The pandemic has reinforced the need for a broad crisis-financing base, and the role of private donors is expected to grow and evolve, including person-to-person giving and support from corporate philanthropic trusts and foundations. \n\nPrivate corporations and their philanthropic trusts and foundations accounted for 14% (US$4.1 billion) of total international humanitarian assistance provided by private donors between 2015 and 2019. Historically, private trusts and corporations have focused the majority of their funding on natural disaster preparedness and response, with less engagement in protracted crisis and conflict contexts. However, as alternative sources of finance are sought to close the humanitarian financing gap, the role of international corporations in all settings is anticipated to grow. Private actors are also expected to continue moving beyond a donor mentality toward a ‘corporate partnership’ approach, encompassing a wide range of activities, from sharing technical expertise to providing logistical support in crisis settings.\n\nUnfortunately, FTS data provides limited and inconsistent insights into the behaviour of private trusts and corporations. Large gaps in donor reporting year-to-year limit the reliability of the data, and comprehensive information on aid flows from private trusts and corporation aid is not available",

      "Document Title": "Humanitarian procurement: Challenges and opportunities in the adoption of WASH product operations",
      "Key Findings": "On the demand side, the research identified a number of challenges: Specifications being too tight, reducing the scope for innovative products to be considered. Also, specifications for the same products differing between agencies; creating ‘markets of one’.  Performance requirements for WASH products determined by the need to have a reliable solution, and to have it quickly and at volume in an emergency response. These requirements can often be beyond the capabilities of innovation teams at the start of their scaling journey. Funding of innovations focused almost exclusively on the ‘supply’ of innovation, with insufficient attention paid to how to stimulate the demand. Significant difficulties for innovations to move beyond ‘innovator’ users to early adopters in the humanitarian sector. Disincentives for adoption outweigh incentives to adopt. Unclear evidentiary requirements for innovators, with humanitarian agencies continually seeking more evidence before they are willing to use an innovation. Connecting supply and demand in the sector also has some significant challenges. Most notably: Procurement processes are often opaque, overly bureaucratic and risk averse. Partnerships that are formed to create innovations are suddenly thrust into competitive procurement processes after the product has been piloted. This can disincentivise innovation. Clockspeed; the speed at which sector-wide and organisational processes happen has significant impact on when, where and how procurement is carried out. This leads to sector-specific idiosyncrasies that need to be factored into the thinking around innovation adoption.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This paper puts forward three recommendation areas in which systemic improvements could be made to enable WASH to cross this chasm. These are:\n1. Stimulate early adoption\n2. Harmonise and Aggregate Demand\n3. Create Longitudinal Demand",

      "Key Findings": "The overarching aims of the HBMM Framework are as follows:\n1) To support governments and communities to address\nthe mobility dimensions of public health threats; and\n2) To ensure that affected and at-risk populations benefit from appropriate and timely support.\nThese efforts are central to safeguarding global health security and strengthening mobility-sensitive health systems that deliver person-centred universal health\ncoverage, including for migrants.",
      "Key Recommendations": "HBMM is a public health framework that should be primarily applied and used by IOM to support governments and communities in the context of\noutbreak-prone communicable diseases including, but not limited to, those that result in a PHEIC declaration\nunder the IHR. These can include, for example, yellow fever, cholera, plague, EVD, COVID-19 and other similar public health threats. Certain activities of the HBMM Framework, such as those that aim to improve the understanding of\npopulation mobility patterns in relation to disease spread, may also be applied in other contexts of communicable disease transmission across borders, such as in the case of elimination efforts for malaria,\npolio and measles, where population mobility may result in the reintroduction of previously eliminated diseases in host communities. In all contexts, the HBMM Framework emphasizes equity and inclusiveness for migrants along the entire mobility continuum – that is, through origin, transit, destination and return. In other words, it is not only\nfocused on communicable disease threats at physical or regulated borders or points of entry (including airports, ports and ground crossings) or entities welcoming migrants for admission and stay-related\nprocedures (including external providers, embassies and consulates). HBMM also includes locations where informal cross-border movements take place, travel\nroutes and spaces of vulnerability where the risk of disease transmission may be high, and public health. Spaces of vulnerability are geographical areas and locations where migrants and mobile populations interact with stationary, local communities, such as where these populations live, work, transit and originate. These locations represent an environment that is conducive to increased health vulnerabilities, such as\noutbreaks. Examples of spaces of vulnerability include PoEs, mobility corridors, points of congregation\nor population gathering sites, key\nhubs including urban spaces, towns and villages and displacement camps and camp-like settings. An analysis of human behaviour and mobility in the setting informs how the HBMM Framework is applied on the ground. interventions would be necessary.",

      "Key Findings": "Due to the challenges linked to rapid urbanization, the world is interested in establishing smart cities. Although there is an increasing requirement to initiate smart cities, these projects entail challenges, which must be overcome for the success of the project. To overcome these challenges, stakeholder management was identified as the ideal solution. Enabling stakeholder engagement was recognized as key to project success during stakeholder management. From the literature survey, 13 stakeholders in smart city projects were identified. In addition, a desktop and a case study were conducted in Sri Lanka to identify the stakeholders and factors that ensured stakeholder engagement. Compared with the analysis of the results from of literature review and the desktop study, 10 stakeholders and their contributions to smart city projects were determined. The identified stakeholders from the desktop study and the literature review were then validated by conducting a case study in Sri Lanka. Based on the case analysis, the identified stakeholders were categorized as internal and external stakeholders based on the characteristics of the stakeholders. Government, LRABs, financial suppliers or investors, utility suppliers, and developers were categorized as internal stakeholders in smart city projects and citizens, ARIs, the media, opposition political parties, and nongovernmental organizations were identified as external stakeholders in smart city projects. From the case analysis, factors that ensured the engagement of each identified stakeholder were recognized. Therefore, the key findings of this study could be utilized to facilitate a basis to investigate the current level of engagement of stakeholders, assist decision makers in stakeholder management, and formulate the strategies the ensure the effective engagement of stakeholders in smart city development projects in Sri Lanka and similar countries globally. Overall, the findings of this study could contribute to enriching knowledge for the effective engagement of stakeholders in smart city projects, which could ensure the efficient and effective development of smart cities globally",

The topic is new and needs further development and coordination among various actors.\n3. Given the importance and the urgency of gender in the ongoing COVID-19 situation, the time to act is now.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The key considerations for the private sector are to:\n1. Ensure the collection of disaggregated data and gender analysis as part of the business market analysis, including liaising with local women organizations to understand all needs.\n2. Leverage the gendered analysis to target humanitarian support in the best possible way, and use empowering practices for women, women workers, women-owned businesses and the informal sector; and to always conduct these actions according to the humanitarian principles including “do no harm”.\n3. Take part in capacity-strengthening initiatives on gender, as well as applying the related tools and the business case (the latter as soon to be provided by the CBi Secretariat) in practice. Liaise with the CBi Secretariat, in the case of CBi MNs, to express their interest to develop pilots and receive technical support on gender in private sector disaster management.\n4. In the response and recovery to COVID-19, seek to address gender and consider the pandemic as a window of opportunity to change gender norms that may be harmful for people and businesses.",

      "Key Findings": "In conclusion, we found that people affected by crises want the what (services), responders want the how (to provide better services), and researchers want to provide the why (a health impact framework supporting WASH). (17)\n\nOverall, people affected by crises primarily wanted services: water, sanitation, solid waste disposal, and hygiene items. Global survey respondents primarily wanted better mechanisms to provide services: collaboration with government, increased WASH expertise, and community engagement. WASH practitioners fell in the middle, and the literature expressed a need for a health impact framework for supporting WASH interventions.",
      "Key Recommendations": "More research and concerted action is recommended to determine:\n• How the gaps identified and any plans to further explore and address them can align with the recently created WASH sector Roadmap\n2020–2025\n• How existing evidence and solutions can fill identified gaps and where new research and innovation may be needed\n• How each individual donor, responder, government, agency, and\nresearch institution can incorporate the results of this report to inform their programming, to engage and participate with the humanitarian cluster coordination platforms (where activated), incorporate results into guidance (e.g. Sphere Standards), and improve WASH humanitarian response activities to reduce the burden of disease and provide dignity and security to people affected by crises.",

      "Document Summary": "This document discusses how to eliminate malaria in hard to reach places in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. It shows how the  private sector and local communities work together to improve surveillance and detection of malaria cases in remote forested areas and works to answer the question of whether their elimination strategies work. Ethnographic research was conducted to see if the elimination strategies work in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos. The results of the ethnographic research show that different factors limited or enhanced the effectiveness of the participation from local communities and the private sector due to inter-ethnic tensions and the local population’s sensitivity to malaria testing and treatment. The document concludes that “hard-to-reach” areas will remain isolated without a proper investigation and localized research, since universalistic malaria elimination strategies are not accepted by the local communities like people thought they would. ",
      "Key Findings": "Diferent types of factors limited or enhanced the efectiveness of the participatory approaches in the diferent settings. In Vietnam, inter-ethnic tensions and sensitivity around forest-work negatively afected local population’s health-seeking behaviour and consequent uptake of malaria testing and treatment. In Laos, the location of the project collaborative pharmacies in the district-centre were a mismatch for reaching hard-to-reach populations in remote villages. In Cambodia, the strategy of recruiting community malaria-workers, elected by the community members, did manage to reach the remote forested areas where people visited or stayed.",
      "Key Recommendations": "‘Hard-to-reach’ populations remain hard to reach without proper research identifying the socio-eco-nomic-political environment and the key dynamics determining uptake in involved communities and populations.\nSolid implementation research with a strong ethnographic component is required to tailor malaria elimination strategies to local contexts.",

      "Document Title": "Private Engagement in Education in Emergencies: Rights and Regulations",
      "Key Findings": "Efforts to secure inclusive and equitable education for all have prompted calls for greater engagement by the private sector, asserting that businesses and foundations can play significant roles as partners in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4).\n\nIn recent years, given shortfalls in public financing and the need for urgent responses, private actors have increasingly become involved in various aspects of educational programming for education in emergencies (EiE). This arrangement, however, can produce tensions between private engagement and humanitarian response in education, which need to be addressed and in turn require extra coordination, advocacy and attention. This brief explores some of these tensions and makes recommendations to support the prioritization of safe, equitable, and quality public education for all children and young people affected by crises. \n\nVarious non-state actors play a central role in education in emergencies. For instance, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) frequently act as funders and implementers\nof education programs in contexts of crisis, often supporting state-driven activities.\n\nThe unique interplay between for-profit actors and EiE elicits particular tensions: between the urgent needs that might be met more efficiently by the private sector (e.g. financing, innovation), according to popular perception, on the one hand, and the rights-based concerns about ensuring equity and access, and preventing exploitation on the other. For example, as the world grapples with the impact of COVID-19 on education and related school closures, the private sector has taken on a prominent role in enabling virtual learning and supplying educational technology.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The key recommendations for Private Sector Participation in Education in Emergence (EiE) are: prioritize the \"do no harm\" principle of humanitarianism; prioritize the participation of affected communities; support the long-term sustainability of public education; regulate private sector activities; promote transparency in profit-seeking activities; ensure that private funding to EiE is transparent, equitable, and harmonized; develop specific guidance on private participation in EiE.

      "Key Findings": "The study’s results showed how NAL in Ghana has taken proactive steps to sustainably meet the socioeconomic needs of its impacted communities. The company linked discretionary CSR with stakeholder ap-\nproach to achieving sustainable results, setting up partnerships with appropriate government and NGOs to implement CSR programs. The degree and extent of stakeholder participation processes have improved partnerships between the stakeholders and NAL.\n\nThe structure and shape of the CSR interventions were focused on both direct and indirect needs of people in the community. It can be summarized, therefore, that the CSR programs of NAL are self-sustaining as a result of its strategic goal to extend the life span of initiatives. CSR results have ultimately greatly impacted on the triple bottom line sustainable practices comprising economic, social and environment. We, thus, reach the conclusion that successful stakeholders’ engagement in CSR initiatives of mining companies’ has facilitated a cordial relationship free of disputes in the mining communities of NAL. \n\nThe findings show that stakeholders in the mining areas are involved in the CSR meetings and discussions organised by NAL. Moreover, we also draw the conclusion that the level of their contribution and participation has led to sustainable CSR results which will benefit generations unborn. Finally, the study found that the integration of stakeholder strategies into CSR resulted in excess demand from various stakeholders. This usually\nincreases the company’s role and responsibility and costs, resulting in poor voluntary involvement by stakeholders.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It is therefore suggested that further studies involving a cross-industry contrast of stakeholder participation and the sustainability of CSR results in Ghana and other emerging countries could be conducted. This would give communities the opportunity to learn the different strategies that industries are pursuing to sustain their CSR activities in the area of community growth. Besides, it is notable that due to hectic schedules of some of the managers, initially; they were unwilling to take part in the in-\nterviews. However, this constraint was surmounted by going to them personally and appealing to them to answer the interview questions whiles reducing the interview times. Even in all instances, the interviews were recorded to avert any danger of eroding the data’s quality. Moreover, in a qualitative study like ours, detailed interviews were used to collect data and measures (ie, moderation) were put in place to overcome the flaws related to subjectivity. It is also notable that though there were interview guides which were prepared in English, yet the interviews were conducted in our local dialect “Akan”. The seeming problem of respondents misunderstanding resulting from such process was decreased because the researchers were native “Akan” speakers. Finally, the sustainability of CSR results and stakeholder participation could be conducted among various industries. In so doing, host communities will be acquainted with different strategies that these businesses are pursu-\ning to sustain their CSR activities. ",

Bayesian analyses showed that there was a 99% probability of any intervention effect on GWG among women with overweight and obesity, and an 81% probability that this effect was over 1 kg. The intervention group had higher scores for the Swedish Healthy Eating Index at follow-up than the control group (0.27; 95% CI 0.05-0.50; P=.017). We observed no statistically significant differences in body fatness, MVPA, glycemia, and insulin resistance between the intervention and control group at follow up (P≥.21). Although we found no overall effect on GWG, our results demonstrate the potential of a smartphone app (HealthyMoms) to promote healthy dietary behaviors as well as to decrease weight gain during pregnancy in women with overweight and obesity.",

      "Key Findings": "Supporting financial service providers (FSPs) in developing financial services to a new underserved segment such as female smallholder farmers, while taking advantage of innovative digital financial services (DFS) technologies, is an undertaking that has many “moving parts.” Firms that are attracted to providing such financial services are in many cases young enterprises that may undergo frequent changes as they adapt and grow. Such changes may include shifts in their ownership structure, the establishment of new partnerships, high staff turnover, as well as changes to their market strategy, to name a few. These changes, which are part of the growth process, may generate some level of instability and organizational shifts that could create competing priorities, which in turn affect the execution of technical assistance (TA) engagements. In addition, the complexity of expanding the supply of services to new underserved segments, sometimes in new countries, and making use of new technologies that are evolving, should not be underestimated. \n\n- Women in rural areas, and in particular female farmers, have significantly less access to financial services than their male counterparts.\n- Digital financial services (DFS) have the potential to unlock financial services for women in agriculture; however, currently, significant gender gaps exist in DFS access and usage.\n\nAlthough the three FSPs operated in different country contexts, with different motivations and scope of services, and received TA that varied in scope and in timing, the following common trends emerged from market research:\n- Male and female smallholder farmers can lead different economic lives despite living in the same household. \n- A woman’s agency—her ability to make choices and act on those choices—can be influenced by her life stage and her marital conditions.\n- Low levels of literacy do not necessarily affect women’s ability to make use of digital financial services.\n- Female farmers may need different financial products than their male counterparts, and those products may need to be marketed differently.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Select Providers That Are Gender Sensitive or That Demonstrate a Strong Interest in Reorienting Their Business Systems, Culture, and Processes toward Gender Equality\n- Align Technical Assistance Funding to Partner Firms’ Existing Interests, KPIs, Partnerships, and Timelines\n- Include a Rigorous Business Case Analysis within the Partner’s Existing Business Model\n- Targeted Technical Assistance in Early Stages Can Have an Impact, but Additional Mechanisms such as RiskSharing Facilities and Investments May Be Needed at a Later Stage to Support Implementation and to Scale-up Viable Services ",

Scale-up continued under a special waiver that allowed drug shop operators who were working with implementing partners to provide injectables until a policy shift allowing trained DSOs to provide injectables was achieved. This handbook captures Uganda’s key developments and lessons in the advocacy process to support this community-based service-delivery channel, along with highlights from other countries’ experiences with drug shop operator provision of health services. The nine program components described mirror the components in the community health worker (CHW) handbook and are relevant for any family planning (FP) program seeking to increase access to high-quality services by working with drug shops.",

      "Document Title": "A review of studies on green finance banks, research gaps and future directions",
      "Key Findings": "This study is a meta-analysis of studies on green finance. Environmental protection, climate change, social inclusion and sustainability continue to receive attention in the world, and in recent years, the interest in these issues have heightened in the banking industry. A systematic review of 46 relevant papers on green finance in the banking industry accompanied by the content analysis methods served as the methodology of this study. Two themes emerged from the method used: green finance products of banks and determinants of green finance of banks. The results revealed seven prominent green finance products of banks which are green loan/bonds, green investment, climate finance, green infrastructural bonds, green insurance, green securities, and carbon finance. The study also identified key determinants of green finance of banks with the 9 topmost determinants being: risks, banking sector regulations, bank size, environmental policies and climate change, internal practices and ethics, technology and innovation, religion, interest rates, social inclusion and social justice. Furthermore, research and policy gaps which need to be addressed by researchers and policymakers in the banking industry on green finance are in the context of regulations, dimensions of research, risk management, data and models. Specifically, the results revealed that the majority of existing studies were conducted in Asia and Europe leaving other continents like Oceania, South America and Africa as sites where little to no research studies have been conducted on the banking sector.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This study has implications for banks and banking regulations. Managers and employees of banks will understand the essence of promoting green finance to gain a competitive edge in the banking industry. The corporate sustainability, corporate image and financial performance of banks will be enhanced. Banks could strengthen financial inclusion and add to innovative finance products and strengthen corporate sustainability. Finally, from a policy formulation perspective, the analysis in this study could assist regulators and managers to frame policies which embrace the needs of stakeholders, simultaneously positioning banks to have a competitive edge in the banking industry.",

Businesses and initiative owners should disclose what existing data they can, and partners should act where existing data and standards are inadequate\n4. As disclosures improve, standard-setters and platforms must be ready to disseminate to investors\n5.

      "Key Findings": "An analysis of sales and repayment data from OGS and PAYGo suppliers involved in piloting new models for financing and distribution of products in the Bidi Bidi area was also conducted. Initial sales data vastly outperformed initial program targets, demonstrating that a market systems approach to strengthen access to solar energy products could be successful, even in remote and underserved refugee markets.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Product Appropriateness & Availability: All segments would consider 12-month loans at piloted repayment amounts. Prior to the pilot, all segments preferred payments upfront or short loan periods. However, it was identified during the pilot that all consumer segments would accept longer repayment periods e.g. 24 months, which could allow for a smaller subsidy or it us complete removal in the future.\n\nDemand Perception: Future interventions should schedule awareness-raising activities one month prior to sales so that consumers have sufficient time to prepare and save a deposit or purchase amount.\n\nMarket Linkages & Infrastructure: To improve distribution, OGS suppliers used a combination of:\n1.  Sales agents recruited from local VSLAs (given their awareness of local consumer, knowledge of the area, and access to female consumers);\n2. Market activation campaigns, with support with Mercy Corps and VSLAs\n3. The establishment of local service centers, warehousing and retail points (through existing local infrastructure, namely the Mercy Corps Innovation Centers and the ENVenture energy cooperative)\n\nAppropriate Finance: The pilot period enabled validation of many of the original hypotheses around appropriate finance, and with need for additional validation.",

      "Key Findings": "1. The DIB effect varies across DIBs depending on the stakeholders involved, their motivations for using the DIB, and the structure of the DIB\n\n2. A DIB can be an effective change management tool. \n\n3. In many ways, the DIB effects seen are not dissimilar to what has been observed in the PbR market. A key additionality of the DIB is the coalition of outcome funders, investors and intermediaries.\n\n4. Additional stakeholders do result in greater coordination and communication costs. \n\n5. Transitioning to an outcome-based contracting model requires a shift in perspectives, on the part of both providers and outcome funders.\n\n6. Delivery of a DIB requires strong internal and external communication. \n\n7. There have been some teething problems during these pilot DIBs, as service providers noted aspects of the DIB that required more time and resources than expected and budgeted for\n\n8. The role of the intermediary should be carefully considered, to ensure costs and benefits are proportionate\n\n9. Validation costs can be high – there is a trade-off between rigour and cost\n\n10. Measuring cost-effectiveness of the DIB funding mechanism is extremely challenging\n\n11. Legal costs remain high and the DIBs have seen a general willingness to work more flexibly outside formal contractual provisions. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations to FCDO:\n\n1. FCDO can support the wider market in collecting more robust cost data\n\n2. FCDO should consider how it can apply DIBs where most appropriate to its portfolio, based on the parameters set above\n\n3. FCDO should consider following up with DIBs after the end of delivery (building this into contracts as needed) to test the sustainability of outcomes and spillover effects.\n\nRecommendations to the wider DIB sector:\n\n4. Clarify roles and responsibilities upfront.\n\n5. Build flexibilities into the contract to respond to changing situations without having to substantially change contracts. \n\n6. Be transparent and share lessons learned as well as key successes and challenges to support the strengthening of the market.",

      "Document Title": "Consistency case study: actions supporting Article 2.1c of the Paris Agreement in Switzerland",
      "Key Findings": "- Overall strategies and targets are defined, but more ambition and specific operationalisation of the Paris alignment goals is required.\n- Financial policy and regulation discuss mandatory climate-related risk disclosure obligations for the nine largest financial institutions, but fall short of factoring in climate impact considerations.\n- The central bank and financial supervisors will have to consider climate-related financial risks in micro- and macroprudential supervision once the revised CO2 Act has been implemented, but further monetary policy activities have, to date, been decisively rejected.\n- Fiscal policy and carbon pricing are key features of the Swiss climate mitigation policy, but their scope needs to be expanded and climate-misaligned fiscal incentives should be assessed.\n- The public budget is not climate-aligned, and international climate finance requires ratcheting-up.\n- Public financial institutions such as the Swiss Export Risk Insurance (SERV) or the Swiss Investment Fund for Emerging Markets (SIFEM) do not yet have a comprehensive, target-aligned climate strategy or mandate, but some progress is noticeable in the updated SIFEM strategy.\n- Information instruments for climate-aligned investment planning at the national level are well defined, for example in the energy, buildings, transport and agricultural strategies, but the ambition of these strategies needs to be ratcheted up to reflect the net-zero target.\n- Further information instruments such as certified labelling or financial data repositories have not been implemented and discussions on a taxonomy of sustainable economic activities have been postponed.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on the present analysis, we identify the following key next steps and lessons learnt for Switzerland:\n- Switzerland should consistently adopt a holistic approach to sustainable finance by equally valuing (i) the financial risks and opportunities related to climate change and (ii) the climate impacts (double materiality). This entails defining clear adaptation and mitigation finance targets that are in line with the adaptation goals, the national netzero target and the global 1.5°/<2°C target.\n\n- The PACTA assessment should become mandatory and be conducted regularly, at least every two years. The analysis has proven to be a very useful source of comparable, forward-looking information for assessing the degree of alignment of the financial sector.\n\n- Switzerland should update the national sector climate strategies to be in line with the national net-zero strategy, and to ensure that the sector strategies provide the right information for domestic investment decisions. This also includes the definition of binding interim targets, decarbonisation pathways and transition plans for all sectors, including the financial sector, to reduce the risk of assets becoming stranded.\n\n- The imposition of mandatory TCFD-based disclosure requirements for the financial sector and the real economy will require the preparation of clear risk and impact assessment guidance and standardised disclosure templates. These should include the key indicators to be reported, both for climate risks and climate impacts, as well as for mitigation, adaptation and resilience investments.\n\n- The Swiss government should assess and report the climate consistency of the Swiss federal budget and spending plans, net climate finance, and the net effective carbon price for various sectors.\n\n- Switzerland should introduce a binding labelling requirement and verification mechanism, to ensure that financial products are consistent with the climate goals and to prevent 'greenwashing' of investment products.\n\n- Switzerland should establish a public green investment bank to utilise all possible public levers, send important market signals and reduce investment risks. The bank would support market developments at the scale and speed required to fulfil the Paris Agreement goals and to exploit the full potential of innovative financial instruments.\n\nBased on the present analysis, we also identify the following recommendations for the GST in general:\n- The GST should look at the public measures and activities undertaken to implement or support the implementation of Article 2.1c, while also assessing private sector activities. This includes a critical assessment of the level of ambition of the measures taken or planned, and the availability and quality of data required to track progress against the targets.\n\n- Assessing the degree of alignment and misalignment of private financial flows with a comparable, scenario-based and forward-looking methodology should be a key priority.\n\n- Collecting data on both climate-aligned and climate-misaligned public financial flows and budget plans, net climate finance and net carbon pricing should be another priority for the GST.\n\n- The availability and quality of qualitative and quantitative data on public domestic and private climate adaptation and climate resilience finance have to be significantly improved.

      "Document Title": "Platforms Enhancing the Engagement of the Private Sector in Humanitarian Relief Operations",
      "Key Findings": "The preliminary results that emerge from this research can be interesting and useful for both academics and professionals in the two sectors, profit and non-profit. In fact,first of all, the use of the platform makes it possible to concretely help people in need by reaching them through the various humanitarian relief operations; moreover, it can be a good basis for a constructive dialogue to build new projects to achieve further sustainable goals. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated the context of the global crisis, and the need for coordination arises as an even more burning topic. As declared in the “Financial Times” (22 April 2020), the pandemic crisis has underlined the need to work together for the vital safety of single actors and entire supply chains: transforming their supply chains to “just in case” models (FT, 2020). The platform investigated in this research sustains the supply chains in this direction, through concrete and effective coordination, and it may be of example for other realities, in humanitarian contexts as well as in commercial ones. A message contained in this paper is that “the commitment to breaking down the barriers to much closer collaboration across organizational boundaries” [8] (p. 9) is growing to also guarantee an agile supply chain in response to disasters, based on a platform solution. Specifically, the “platform” investigated in the present paper is between the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the Logistics Emergency Teams (LET), composed of four global leading logistics providers.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This study, despite having provided some useful insights on the topic, needs to be deepened, especially in its empirical investigation, with an on-field analysis, which requires a further detailed examination that extends the understanding of platform opportunities and also the criticalities for private sector -humanitarian collaboration. This could be achieved by questionnaires for and semi-structured interviews with the professionals engaged in the platform in its different activities, valorising the analysis of primary data.",

      "Key Findings": "Cash transfers have the potential to be delivered much more efficiently, utilise public-and private-sector capacities more effectively and require fewer organisations than in-kind assistance, which involves multiple parties. The benefits of cash-based interventions increase significantly with the use of e-payment channels, which digitise aid delivery and make it more efficient and transparent. However, mobile money adoption is not widespread in Ethiopia, with barriers including limited access, social and cultural factors, low literacy rates, high cost of operations and lack of infrastructure in remote settings. Partnerships and joint efforts between cash and voucher assistance (CVA) implementers and financial service providers (FSPs) can lead to an increase in both the demand and supply of mobile money solutions, and efficient and large-scale cash-based responses.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The following considerations and actions are recommended for CVA\nimplementers that are looking into using mobile money as a cash delivery channel: \n\nTo decide on a delivery mechanism, CVA implementers should: \n1. Put end-users at the centre.\n2. Measure cost-effectiveness of different disbursement mechanisms.\n3. Remember context is key.\n4. Conduct a feasibility assessment of service delivery providers.\n5. Understand local conditions prior to selecting delivery mechanism and think longer-term.\n6. Consider ways to increase mobile money viability and use.\n7. Advocate where possible and appropriate.\n\nTo select a service provider and define service-level\nagreements, CVA implementers should: \n1. Select an FSP that is appropriate for the specific implementation location.\n2. Ensure service level agreements are clear, cover what is required and are achievable.\n\nTo implement mobile money enabled CVA, CVA implementers should: \n1. Clearly define roles and responsibilities.\n2. Embed digital literacy training into mobile money enabled CVA programming.\n3. Provide ongoing support to recipients.\n4. Raise awareness of recipients of the potential benefits of mobile money use beyond receipt of CVA.\n5. Ensure adequate mechanisms are in place for liquidity management.",

      "Key Findings": "In a post-COVID-19 era, development finance institutions can further support the scaling up of technology companies in emerging markets by intervening more upstream through the development of the enabling environment. In addition, the Private Equity Funds business model is well suited to help navigate companies out of economic crises, and Fund Managers can become partners in rebuilding sectors and economies through reducing equity funding gaps. Regarding smaller or independent companies, financing may require substantial support from development financial institutions. Such support would be critical to preserve competition, improve resilience, and promote digital inclusion for the poorest.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "In the health sector, efforts should focus on collaboration with decision makers at the country and global levels who are able to identify firms that can address the need for training healthcare workers to build capacity. In the financial sector, Development Finance Institutions should collaborate to support local banks. In addition, it is critical for the global development community to remain focused on supporting Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations. ",

      "Key Findings": "In this paper, the various roles of the private sector during climate technology development and transfer processes were successfully identified by analysing the previous Technical Assistances implemented by the private network members on the basis of staged innovation. Each role as technology implementor, incubator for technology scale-\nup and demonstration, and investor to diffuse the technology into the market was clearly revealed in each stage of technology outsourcing, technology demonstration, and technology diffusion during various CTCN Technical Assistance activities, respectively. Furthermore we evaluated the shared interest for the partnership between the CTCN and the private sector through in-depth interviews with major stakeholders including current and potential network members from the private sector, in addition to some government representatives. ",
      "Key Recommendations": " Based on this analysis, we proposed two types of PPPs. Firstly, short-term PPPs and related activities were introduced to enhance the participation of the private sector as implementors in the technology\noutsourcing CTCN Technical Assistance activities. Then, long-term and corresponding activities for a sustainable private partnership were suggested to shift the private sector’s role to incubator or investor for market–pull innovation.",

      "Document Title": "Summary of Evaluator Findings and Lessons from AgResults Prize Competitions: 2013 to 2020",
      "Key Findings": "AgResults is a US$152 million multilateral initiative that tests the use of payment-for-results (PfR) prize competitions as a means of catalysing markets for high-impact agricultural innovations that benefit smallholder farmers in developing countries. AgResults offers prizes to private sector actors (‘competitors’) to encourage them to engage in markets for these innovations. AgResults’ ultimate goal is to develop markets that serve smallholder farmers both during and after the project. To date, AgResults has sponsored nine prize competitions,\nof which four are complete and five are ongoing. The report groups findings into three categories. \n\nFirst, Findings: Impact on market development: \n\n1. Market development. AgResults successfully catalysed private sector engagement in markets for AgResults technologies or for products derived from those technologies.\n2. Constraints to market development. AgResults was most successful in catalysing market development in projects where the key constraints were within the manageable interest of the private sector once incentivized by the prize.\n3. Role of the enabling environment. The enabling environment was usually supportive or neutral to development of markets for AgResults-targeted technologies; however, at times government action or inaction impeded the market’s initial development or its sustainability.\n4. Strong business case. AgResults was most successful in engaging the private sector when the private sector perceived a strong business case for investing in the market.\n5. Smallholder farmer inclusion. AgResults successfully promoted inclusion of smallholder farmers in targeted markets, either through explicit project rules or by leveraging the smallholder-inclusive nature of the underlying markets.\n6. Inclusion of women. AgResults had mixed results in terms of inclusion of women in the markets it developed.\n7. Market sustainability. There are mixed indications about the likely sustainability of markets catalysed by AgResults.\n8. Economies of scale. Sustainability appears to be enhanced when the private sector makes ‘lumpy’ investments that lead to economies of scale.\n\nSecond, Findings: Impact on smallholder farmers: \n\n1. Technology adoption. AgResults competitors were able to substantially increase smallholder farmers’ adoption of the targeted technologies.\n2. Income. Technology uptake sometimes, but not always, led to increases in farmer incomes. In Kenya, income impacts were negligible, mainly because farmers used the technology (improved on-farm storage) as a substitute for one they already had (pesticides).\n3. Non-financial benefits. Some farmers also reported non-financial benefits related to adoption of the technology.\n4. Farmer knowledge. The PfR approach left farmers with some gaps in their knowledge about use, consumption, and health benefits of the technologies.\n5. Women’s participation. Women can face inherent disadvantages in market-based approaches like AgResults, but gender-sensitive project design can help offset these disadvantages.\n6. Deviations from projected impact. Certain farmer benefits were not realised to the extent projected, underscoring how farmer response to new technologies may differ from expectations.\n\nLastly, Findings: Cost and cost-effectiveness: \n\n1. Risk reduction benefit to prize sponsors. PfR projects have a financial risk reduction benefit to sponsors since prize pay-outs happen only if results are achieved. At the same time, PfR projects involve some costs regardless of whether all prizes are paid out. In the\ntwo projects that were terminated early, sponsors’ costs for management, verification, and initial prizes amounted to 52% of what they had planned to spend on the projects.\n2. Management, verification, and prize costs. PfR projects incur costs to manage the competition, verify whether competitors meet prize requirements, and pay the prizes. The relative share of these costs varies considerably from project to project depending on the type of technology and design of the competition. In the two completed projects, for example, management costs were 44% of one project’s total costs and 25% of the other. Verification was 26% of one project’s costs and 7% of the other. Prizes amounted to 30% of one project’s costs and 69% of the other.\n3. Contextualisation of cost-effectiveness results. Cost-effectiveness measures, such as cost per smallholder farmer adopting the technology, can provide useful insights if interpreted with care. Comparing costs across technologies or implementation contexts\ncan be misleading, given that complexity, benefits, and costs of uptake are likely to differ.",

      "Document Title": "Enabling Private Investment in Climate Adaptation & Resilience",
      "Key Findings": "Analyses by the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) have shown the benefits would be significant:\n1. Investing US$1.8 trillion globally in five target areas from 2020 to 2030 could produce US$7.1 trillion in total benefits. The five target areas are early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, improved dryland agriculture crop production, global mangrove protection, and projects to make water resources more resilient.\n2. Spending US$800 million on early warning systems in developing countries could reduce climaterelated disaster losses by US$3–16 billion per year. \n\nYet investments in adaptation and resilience-building around the world continue to fall far short of documented needs. It is also increasingly clear that although public finance for adaptation has increased, it will not suffice. Private sector investment is critical to closing the adaptation finance gap. \n\nMuch remains to be learned, however, about how to unlock and enable private capital to help finance national and local adaptation priorities. There is growing knowledge of how the private sector is building its own climate resilience, but far less about its role in meeting broader adaptation financing needs. Building on pioneering literature identifying barriers to private sector investment in adaptation, this report aims to offer concrete guidance on how to overcome those barriers. \n\nGuidance for governments is particularly urgent as nations rebuild their economies in the post-COVID era. It is important to ensure that investments contribute to both near-term economic recovery and longer-term resilience, mainly by anticipating and managing the growing impacts of climate change on all economic sectors. This report provides an overview of the current state of private sector investment in adaptation and resilience and the known barriers to such investment, then proposes a pragmatic Blueprint for Action for public and private stakeholders. It identifies five key entry points as well as ways to create an enabling environment and illustrates each point with case studies.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Governments can play a key role in addressing all three barriers, including by:\n1. Making localized climate risk and vulnerability data available and embedding climate risks in capital investment planning undertaken by governments and their development partners;\n2. Setting up effective institutional arrangements for multi-sector adaptation planning—a better articulation of adaptation and resilience goals at the national level, establishing the policies/regulations/standards, and articulating clear plans, including who will do what, where, when, and how—to enable private sector participation; and\n3. Strengthening financial incentives (or reducing risks/costs) for private participation—through public finance instruments such as blended finance, credit enhancement, and other targeted risk reduction or revenue-boosting measures.\n\nThe Blueprint describes three areas for intervention for public sector stakeholders: policy, incentives, and standards, metrics and regulations. It also identifies five entry points to enable private investment in adaptation:\n1. Support long-term adaptation planning, taking a whole-of government approach.\n2. Develop a national adaptation investment plan, which flows naturally from a well-developed national adaptation and resilience strategy,  to outline a portfolio of projects that are ready for investment by public or private entities, domestic and international.\n3. Conduct a market assessment and screen the pipeline for “bankable” projects for different investors.\n4. Provide ongoing support for project preparation.\n5. Support individual projects to close the transaction.",

      "Key Findings": "- Commodity partnerships are stronger when governments and private providers co-create formal terms of engagement.\n- Commodity partnerships require comprehensive investments in capacity-building interventions.\n- Intermediaries can facilitate commodity partnerships.\n- Demand creation supports commodity partnerships.\n- Governments and stakeholders need to understand the specific challenges they want to address and design appropriate interventions.\n- Partnerships need a vision for long-term sustainability.\n\nMany governments and donors support the use of public-private\npartnerships to distribute publicly managed commodities through\nthe private health sector to overcome barriers to access for the\nfull range of family planning methods. This brief draws on country\nexperiences with commodity partnerships for family planning\nin Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania. It documents approaches used\nto place government-managed commodities into the hands of\nprivate providers and ultimately the women seeking the method. It\nexamines factors that motivated public and private actors to pursue\npartnerships to enable private sector provision of long-acting\nreversible contraceptives, and how well the implementation of the\npartnerships aligned with those motivations. The brief discusses the challenges and lessons learned from this experience, and concludes with reflections about when and how donors and governments might decide to replicate, improve, or scale up these partnerships.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Public-private commodity partnerships come with trade-offs for governments and private providers. On the one hand, they can lower costs and increase access to family planning and other essential services in the private sector. On the other, they can be costly to start, maintain, and scale up. They may unintentionally delay or disrupt the development of a more sustainable private commodity market. Policy makers and donors need to reflect on these tradeoffs and the goals of their family planning programs when deciding if a partnership makes sense, and if so, how to move forward. Key considerations are listed below:\n\n- The level of demand for family planning overall and for LARCs\nspecifically.\n- Specific barriers limiting availability of LARCs in the private sector.\n- Capacity of public supply chains to manage procurement and\ndistribution.\n- Availability of complementary investments.\n\nBy taking into account the country contexts and lessons identified in this brief, governments and donors can design better-functioning partnerships that meet the needs of providers and clients, and strengthen national family planning programs.",

      "Document Title": "E3 Analytics and Evaluation Project",
      "Key Findings": "The E3 Bureau lacked a common definition or conceptual framework for capacity development, which limited understanding and application of\nthe principles that underlie effective capacity development support.\nWhile capacity development is a core part of USAID’s work, E3 staff primarily described it in terms of training. This raised concerns about the ability of staff to differentiate between stronger and weaker approaches to capacity development\ngiven a set of desired development outcomes. The effectiveness of capacity development practices often depends on how they are\nimplemented. For example, organizational twinning can be highly effective, but the “twins”\nneed to be well chosen and the relationship needs to be mutually beneficial and well managed.\nFurther, incentives that may be effective for eliciting some behavior may undermine intrinsic motivations if they are improperly structured.\nThe E3 Capacity Development Assessment further identified more than 50 promising practices in\ncapacity development that can be modeled, tested, and promoted on a Bureau-wide—and possibly\nAgency-wide—basis. It also included a statement of work rater’s guide that E3 staff can use to review statements of work that include a capacity\ndevelopment component.\nOnce the assessment was completed, the project team disseminated the results and lessons learned to Bureau senior staff specific to each E3 technical office and presented key findings to influential external resources such as Devex and the International Society for Performance\nImprovement. This assessment exemplifies how a mixed-methods study that combines meta-analysis\nand office-specific research can delve into how organizational practices and culture affect the use and results of certain development approaches.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The project’s midterm performance evaluation of USAID’s West Africa Trade and Investment Hub\ninvestigated the sustainability of Agency support to trade associations across multiple countries. A\nreview of third-party financial audits, interviews with association leaders and members, and Trade Hub monitoring data painted a mixed picture. These associations provided members\nwith expected benefits such as flashy brochures, lobbying power, and a single point of contact when\ndealing with buyers and governments. Yet the associations needed USAID’s support for three-quarters of their funding to stay operational.\nTwo land tenure evaluations\nconducted by the project team specifically addressed how recognizing land rights affects smallholder farmers’ engagement with the private\nsector across two domains: credit access and contract farming. While both evaluations found that formalizing customary land use led to changes\nin perceptions around land, neither evaluation reported increased private sector engagement in the form of credit access or contract farming.\nLand is not just many peoples’ most critical asset; it is often a foundational part of their identity. It is important to keep this in mind when considering\nhow soon one can expect to see the benefits of economic growth activities. In a midterm evaluation of one\nof USAID’s flagship blended finance activities, the project team found that relatively little investment\nhad been mobilized. USAID staff, however, felt that the activity added huge value through small-\nscale technical support, such as due diligence, procurement facilitation, and connecting USAID with new partners. In thinking about what success\nlooks like, it was critical to appropriately define expectations. The headline here was not, “no\ninvestments were made,” but rather, “niche support for pre-investment activities was provided at scale.”",

      "Key Findings": "A national health management information system (HMIS) is the\nfoundation for effective oversight, management, and provision of\nhealth information, products, and services in a country. The private\nsector is often a significant source of health products and services,\nyet few countries have fully galvanized routine reporting by private\nhealth care providers. This results in incomplete data on the types,\nvolumes, and quality of services and products delivered through\nprivate sector channels and limits the ability of public health officials to effectively engage and steward both the public and private health sectors. To address this gap, this report establishes a framework for examining and supporting private sector participation in a national HMIS. The framework identifies common barriers to private provider engagement in a national HMIS, shares global case studies, and offers actionable recommendations to governments, private providers, donors, and implementing partners.\n\nLooking forward:\n- There is not a one-size-fits-all approach to private sector inclusion.\n- An inclusive national HMIS requires significant resources and prioritization.\n- Reporting must align with operational priorities and practices.\n- Inclusion of frontline providers in an HMIS is increasingly important.\n- Integration of parallel health information systems can enhance private sector reporting.\n- Market-based solutions may incentivize sustainable private sector reporting.\n- Technology plays an important supportive role in HMIS inclusion.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- MOH: Operationalize and enforce policies that motivate timely and complete routine reporting in the private sector.\n- MOH and private provider: Define how private sector data will be used.\n- MOH: Engage non-clinical facilities providing essential services.\n- Private provider: Join or form a private sector health association.\n- MOH and private provider: Engage private providers in an HMIS steering committee and an HMIS community of practice.\n- MOH and private provider: Develop an action plan.\n- MOH: Conduct a private sector census to complete MFL.\n- MOH: Require alignment of priority indicators across all stakeholders working with private providers.\n- MOH: Support integration between the national DHIS2 instance and all other DHIS2 instances that capture private facility data.\n- MOH: Configure direct reporting in DHIS2.\n- MOH: Create a DHIS2 training instance for private providers.\n- MOH: Equitably distribute reporting tools for all registered facilities.\n- MOH and private provider: Explore alternative submission arrangements for paper reporting forms.\n- MOH and private provider: Develop digital solutions to facilitate reporting.\n- MOH: Create modular reporting forms to reflect private sector services.\n- Private provider: Identify priority indicators for feedback.\n- MOH: Provide electronic and paper-based feedback reports at district and regional levels.",

      "Key Findings": "To gain a broad representation of the Sudanese private sector as it relates to potential humanitarian sector alignment, the PSLA team documented recurring feedback from interviewees related to the private sector’s relationship to and engagement with development initiatives and humanitarian assistance in Sudan, which is summarized below:\n\n● Flooding is a primary disaster concern for the private sector, and many companies focus their CSR efforts on flood relief.\n● The lack of energy access is a major barrier for reaching and developing remote areas.\n● The lack of access to finance is a challenge for all sectors, but especially for small-scale farmers and MSMEs.\n● The lack of access to skilled workers is a challenge for larger companies.\n● A strong market push towards livestock presents a potential shift to future investment.\n● Advancements in the technology sector create opportunities for innovative humanitarian solutions.\n● A lack of sustainable storage infrastructure and warehousing is a major obstacle for supply \nchains.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The PSLA highlighted several opportunities for both ways USAID/BHA can best approach the Sudanese private sector for potential partnership, as well as shared-value partnerships that advance the business goals of companies while also supporting USAID/BHA prioritized development objectives. These opportunities are summarized below.\n\nWays of working with the private sector: \n\n● Build trust to develop partnerships. Try to understand the world views and motivations of the private sector.\n● Find a common language. Establish an understanding of USAID/BHA’s mandate and objectives, ask questions when there is uncertainty, and explain partnership rationale.\n● Include the private sector in the co-design process, either as a resource partner or as an implementing partner.\n● Set clear expectations and maintain transparency around timelines. Ensure clarity and transparency around processes, timelines, and contractual expectations.\n\nShort- and Medium-Term Opportunities: \n\n● Leverage RISING model to expand resilience. Build off the existing RISING partnership model to expand the humanitarian areas it covers.\n● Support microfinance / agricultural finance. Facilitate the expansion of agricultural finance to rural and marginalized small-holder and contract farmers; encourage finance\ncompanies to meet the 12% legal microfinance requirement; connect finance companies with organizations that can help them understand needed financial products.\n● Encourage energy access for remote areas. Deploy renewable energy solutions as part of humanitarian relief; work with renewable energy companies to identify the sector’s\nneeds for expanding solar energy solutions; consider renewable energy as a complementary component of holistic solutions.\n● Invest in innovation and technology. Work with startups and entrepreneurs to fund, design, and co-create innovative solutions for farmers and vulnerable populations.\n● Resilient warehousing and sustainable housing. Support the capacity and reach of construction companies to provide sustainable warehousing and housing solutions for farmers and rural populations; leverage the interest of agriculture companies in building warehouses and storage facilities to partner on these initiatives; support farming cooperatives to communally store their grain and other products for purchase.\n● Support the shift to livestock. Expand the market push towards the cattle and poultry value chains by encouraging conglomerates to apply the contract farming model to livestock; explore the hyde and leather value chains; consider support through ecosystem-focused partnerships that also address market strengthening, finance, training, etc.",

      "Key Findings": "The analysis begins in Chapter 2 by providing an overview of the status and trends in peacebuilding and specifically locally-led peacebuilding. This chapter unfolds a nonexhaustive review of the current key frameworks and policies that underpin the global peacebuilding system\nas we know it today, as well as providing an overview of key challenges and outlining some of the most common systemic dysfunctionalities of the current global system of support for locally-led peacebuilding.\nChapter 3 then builds on this analysis and takes a wider perspective on some of the emerging societal and geopolitical global trends within which the peace and development system operates, seeking to illuminate key areas to track which are likely to have an impact of systems change for locally-led peacebuilding.\nChapter 4 takes a deep dive into the global peacebuilding system, its structures, key actors, their potential for change and the critical importance of their interlinkages as it relates to support for locally-led peacebuilding. The importance of looking beyond institutional entities and\nto the change agents within and outside these entities is furthermore discussed.\nChapter 5 pivots to an analysis of a spectrum (nested paradigm) of different approaches of direct support to locally-led peacebuilding to broader systems change in the service of local peacebuilding. Furthermore, organisational approaches, or ways of working, that align with the values of and enable locally-led peacebuilding are discussed.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This report concludes with 11 \"calls to action\":\n\nSystemic challenges and obstacles to change:\n1. INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES: There is a need to change the structures, practices, and attitudes that sustain these challenges.\n2. BROADER SYSTEMIC CHALLENGES: There is a need to address both\nthe internal and external dynamics influencing the possibility for change and focus on multiple aspects of the system including the operational dimensions of international institutions and the political pressures from nationalist donor constituencies.\n\nChanging institutional ways of working:\n3. SUSTAINED ENGAGEMENT FOR CHANGE: In order to address this need, some funders have begun innovating and testing longer-term timeframes for support to actors engaged in systems change, however this must be pursued not as a one-off innovation effort but rather as a long-term and sustained way of working.\n4. WALKING THE TALK: Transforming organisations to be better fit for supporting locally-led peacebuilding will require self-reflection on how structures, practices and attitudes can be adapted and changed. And it\nrequires daring to take concrete steps to elicit change– beyond the mounting talk about ‘decolonising aid’ among peers.\n\nPursuing change that has a real impact for locally-led peacebuilding:\n5. MOVING BEYOND LESSONS LEARNED: There is a need to rethink\nstrategies of how lessons learned on promising practices can inspire broader systems change.\n6. MOVING BEYOND POLICY CHANGE: It is necessary to focus\non systems change efforts beyond policy engagement which would imply more long-term and accompanying engagement.\n\nNew frontiers for change:\n7. REIMAGINING THE GLOBAL PEACEBUILDING SYSTEM: The time is ripe to pursue processes to reimagine the peacebuilding system, developing new principles for how to support locally-led peacebuilding, and\noperationalising these reimagined change visions and principles within the existing structures as well as in new types of structures.\n8. SENSE-MAKING IN A GLOBAL SYSTEM IN FLUX: The challenges and\nopportunities it creates, requires sustained analysis, sensing and sense-making, as well as strategic reflection, navigating in uncertainty, and emergent adaptive action.\n\nCollaborating to drive change:\n9. COMPLEMENTARITIES AND COLLECTIVE ACTION: There is a need to actively seek complementarity among multiple actors pursuing different approaches and seeking change through diverse leverage points.\n10.

      "Document Title": "Scaling up climate finance in the context of Covid-19",
      "Key Findings": "Accelerating the transition to reduce emissions along a P1 or P2 pathway is required to maximize development co-benefits and achieve both the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. The P1 and P2 pathways, which entail reducing energy demand and improving energy efficiency, are technical feasible for both adaptation and mitigation. Financing a P1 or P2 pathway will require significantly more investment and investment in a different set of low emission, climate resilient assets.\n\nHowever, inertia on the part of the financial system means that in the absence of policy interventions, the financial system will not be able to redirect carbon private capital on the needed scale. This will lead towards a P3 or P4 scenario with greater tension with sustainable development outcomes and more severe overshoots cannot be excluded. The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbates this inertia, and with the large fiscal stimulus measures, ‘colourless’ investments co ld tip the world beyond the 1.5°C threshold within a decade and the 2°C limit soon after 2050.\n\nTo avoid this irreversible outcome, financial flows must first be shifted towards a P1 and P2 pathway. This can be achieved through a combination of market fixing and shaping efforts. Deploying both approaches in tandem helps overcome the constraints inherent to each approach and increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of public policies and finance to scale up climate action.\n\nSecond, four strategic interventions could enable developing countries to address the additional economic and financial challenges created by the pandemic for developing countries to realize their climate ambitions. Together these four interventions – support to integrated and costed climate policy and plans; alleviating developing countries’ debt burden; leveraging sovereign and multi-country guarantee funds; and increasing developing countries’ access to the green bond market – would enable developing countries to foster a green, climate resilient recovery from the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThese four immediate actions could also have a structural positive impact on the future climate policy architecture. They could a) facilitate the deployment of carbon pricing since de-risking mechanisms will increase the volume of low-carbon investments at a given carbon price; b) magnify the impact of financial transparency and disclosure though the emergence of investments and asset classes of higher credibility; c) reduce the fragmentation of climate and development finance; and d) enhance the capacity of official climate and development assistance to support nonmarketable services.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Integrating policies on climate action, sustainable development, and Covid-19 stimulus to minimize incremental investment requirements and optimize development co-benefits\n\n2. Alleviating developing countries’ debt burden to create fiscal space to finance their green, climate-resilient recovery plans\n\n3. Leveraging sovereign and multi-country guarantee funds to reduce investment risk and catalyse private finance\n\n4. Increasing developing countries’ access to the green bond market",

      "Document Title": "Tourism partnerships: Harnessing tourist compassion to ‘do good’\nthrough community development in Fiji",
      "Key Findings": "This article has explored the tension between the commodification of tourist desire to ‘do good’ in destination communities and a commitment on the part of tourism businesses to sustainable tourism development, adding to the literature on critical tourism studies, and extending critical voluntourism literature to the examination of tourist involvement in community development. Evidence shows that tourist compassion is commodified by tourism companies in the pursuit of meeting changing tourist demands, as well as to contribute visibly to their community support efforts and maintain good relationships with nearby communities. The drive to create opportunities for tourists to contribute to community development effectively commodifies the desire to ‘to good’ and shifts the responsibility from hotels to tourists to counter unsustainable development and poverty in destination communities. The assistance offered is then rather superficial and does not necessarily meet the priorities of communities. To address actual needs and the structural causes of poverty and inequality in order to produce change is likely to be too uncomfortable and difficult for tourists. It might also require addressing tourist behaviour. This is inconsistent with the notion of the ‘feel-good’ tourist experience.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In terms of meeting the SDGs, we suggest that a more critical approach needs to be taken to tourism partnerships, with further research needed to examine the development impacts of tourism partnerships, and the role of tourists in these partnerships. We see some evidence of mobilising and sharing knowledge and expertise and examples of some effective private sector-civil society partnerships. There is less evidence of creating space for local leadership. Critical analysis is needed from tourism scholars to consider how tourism partnerships can best meet the SDGs. \n\nWe conclude that if tourist compassion is to be harnessed to benefit host destinations, then tourist companies must acknowledge local leadership and be open to alternative approaches that allow for community agency. By stepping outside of the imperative to feel good and look good in order to do good, tourists can also open up possibilities for increased empathy with destination communities whilst making space for community development aspirations to come to the fore.",

      "Key Findings": "As demonstrated by the three technologies investigated in this paper, holistic applications of technology in HA already exist and have been shown to function well in the field. Microsoft’s AI platform suggests that it is possible for people and machines to work together in a centre-based human approach while achieving faster and more effective results in relief. Flying Labs illustrates how technology can bring innovation to the field, and that, when used inclusively, it can potentially create global equity which will benefit individuals as well as whole communities. Seen in its early stages of development Flying Labs may be considered low priority, however, in time it will come to be regarded as an essential tool in empowering populations. Lastly, Smart Cities confirms the viability of flexible infrastructures that create circular economies. In addition to their capacity for self-empowerment, neglected communities have often testified to the resilience of the people themselves.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Since the beginning of the century, innovation has been \nincreasingly considered a fundamental element of HA systems with the potential to positively impact its future. Nevertheless, transformation through technological innovation must involve a human-centered approach and must employ “an iterative process that identifies, adjusts and diffuses ideas for improving humanitarian action” while at the same time taking affected communities into full consideration.\n\n Many challenges still lie ahead, especially in contexts where a deep reflection on ethical implications is crucial to the responsible use of technologies on the ground, and further analysis is required on the approaches and adaptations institutions demonstrate as regards to technology. Putting people first is the central pivot upon which balances the altruism of aid and the misconception that modernization will lead to a better future in relief. Equilibrium may be maintained by adhering to principles that prioritise people above all else.",

      "Key Findings": "This policy note does not aim to define the specific combination of humanitarian and MSD approaches that could be used in FCAS, as this will vary considerably based on the context. Instead, it identifies barriers and provides recommendations so that donors can take the lead in providing appropriate assistance to support the right combination of humanitarian and MSD approaches. Overarching all of this is the expectation of meeting the minimum standards of ’do no harm’ and being ‘market aware’. 2.1 What are the barriers to using the MSD approach in fragile contexts? • Unfamiliarity with systemic approaches, leading to an implicit preference for direct delivery • Lack of awareness of the capacity of local actors • Risk aversion • Lack of preparation • Operational culture 2.2 Building flexibility and adaptation into MSD programmes in fragile contexts • Increase the flexibility of funding\n • Ensure strong data is available for decision-making • Decentralise decision-making 2.3 Are there specific opportunities for MSD to support economic recovery,\nespecially for women, after COVID-19?\n COVID-19 has amplified the key causes of fragility such as weak governance, economic inequality and deficits of public trust. Women are expected to be particularly affected by the economic fallout from COVID-19.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Ten recommendations for MSD programming in fragility\n1) Be market-aware and Do No Harm. No activity is market neutral.\n2) Encourage collaboration by coordinating internally.\n3) Look for opportunities to make funding less siloed.\n4) Engage in active learning and identify where flexibility is possible.\n5) Ensure strong, disaggregated data is available for decision-making.\n6) Improve the context for fragile countries by supporting critical market systems.\n7) Support local private sector.\n8) Invest in women.\n9) Procurement should not distort the market and should support recovery where possible.\n10) Be realistic when working in FCAS. \n",

For\npreparedness activities, PDRF has collaborated with several\norganizations for strategic planning and capacity building.\nNotably, the PDRF OPSCEN and EOC presented opportunities for\ncollaboration that would potentially lead to better optimization of\nthe investment of PDRF in promoting disaster resilience.\nIn managing triple whammy situations, the PDRF EOC successfully\nmobilizes its resources: (1) PDRF member companies; (2)\nActivation of EOC; and (3) HANDA for information management.\nAlthough there were challenges such as communication gaps and\ntravel restrictions, overall response activities were still successful\nand made a significant positive impact on target communities.",
      "Key Recommendations": "For communications, the EOC is developing a more comprehensive feedback mechanism for the member companies on how the activation and response actions. For the EOC itself,\norganizational commitment to support the EOC should be reinstated, especially for prolonged activation. PhilPrep is already a good mechanism for partnership between OCD and PDRF. This just needs to be enhanced and expanded in various disaster\npreparedness activities, aside from the usual capacity building efforts. Examples are simulations/exercises and contingency planning efforts.\nThere could have been stronger coordination and leveraging with\nthe LGUs and the UN because they are major contributors during disasters and need immediate and direct augmentation. As expressed during previous focus group discussions, an OCHA-PDRF bilateral is proposed to discuss strategic priorities for collaboration. This way, PDRF will be more immersed and active in\nthe HCT cluster system and there will be seamless action, for example, in cash-based interventions and bringing private sector expertise.\nIn addition, assistance can be coursed through the LDRRMOs. Maximizing local presence and coordination of the PDRF and its network with the LGUs/Local Disaster Risk Reduction\nManagement Offices (LDRRMO) is crucial since the LGU/LDRRMOs\nare the ones directly needing assistance. This is also pursuant to\nRepublic Act 10121 (an act strengthening the Philippine Disaster\nRisk Reduction and Management System, providing for the\nNational Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Framework and institutionalizing the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan, appropriating funds therefor and for other purposes) in which disaster management always begins at the\nlocal level. Specifically, the private sector can undertake assessment of its capabilities so they can determine what to offer to the government and other partner organizations. Say, at the\nregional/national level, the private sector can interface with OCD\nas the coordinating authority of the Regional/NDRRMC.",

      "Key Findings": "While countries in Asia and the Pacific are at varying levels of maturity in terms of clean energy development and financing, several examples of successful clean energy financing can be found in developing countries of the region. Multilateral development institutions like the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have also been actively engaged in clean energy development, and lessons learned can be valuable in helping identify appropriate financing mechanisms and business models for new project developments. No publication currently provides such information in the context of the developing countries in Asia and the Pacific.\n\nThis book aims to provide an up-to-date account of the financing approaches, policies, and business models available for the development of clean energy resources. These are complemented by appropriate examples of clean energy projects and programs from developing countries in the region. A variety of clean energy projects are covered, including distributed renewable energy systems, hydropower, and those focusing on demand side energy efficiency. The book also discusses key barriers to financing clean energy development and innovative policies and measures adopted to overcome them in different country and project contexts.\n\nThis book is primarily intended to benefit the potential developers of,\nand investors in, clean energy projects, as well as financing institutions and policy makers in the region. The materials may also be useful to interested readers in academia and the research community.",

      "Document Title": "Improving Access to Implants through the Private Sector: Lessons from Tanzania",
      "Key Findings": "The popularity of contraceptive implants is rapidly increasing in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in East Africa where implant users typically obtain the method from government and NGO-supported clinics. In Tanzania, two barriers limit the ability of for-profit private clinics to offer implant services to their clients: sporadic access to training and challenges in obtaining commodities. To address these barriers, SHOPS Plus trained 39 private providers in comprehensive family planning services, including implant insertion and removal. The project also facilitated partnerships with the public sector that enabled providers to receive a supply of free commodities. Six months later, the providers had performed 1,390 implant insertions and 359 removals, with few stockouts. However, the public supply solution made private services dependent on product donations and generally prohibited facilities from charging for implant services. The creation of a private source of implants proved unfeasible as providers were not willing to pay for products as long as they could get them at no cost from the government. SHOPS Plus found that service level agreements between private providers and the government can be highly effective in increasing the volume of implant services but present sustainability challenges. Increasing the viability of this method in the private sector over the long term requires more sustainable training and supply options. Authorities should recognize that for-profit private providers need to charge for services and relax barriers to the distribution of implants through commercial channels.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The private sector access to implants intervention showed that private providers can quickly start delivering implants when product supply and training are more readily accessible. Tanzania was chosen for this intervention because it is a typical market with fast-growing demand for implants. Also, IAP interventions have resulted in highly effective donor and government collaboration. The private sector, however, may lose interest in providing this method if donor support decreases, or the widespread policy of offering free services leads to the belief that implant services are not commercially viable. This potential market failure can be mitigated through policy change and market-based solutions that increase the role of private sector entities.\n\n- Donor-supported training should progressively transition to more sustainable options.\n- Governments could use a more targeted approach in the distribution of free implants.\n- The lack of commercial distribution channels for implants should be addressed globally and locally.\n- Allowing providers to charge realistic prices may be the key to sustaining implant services through the private sector.",

For this guide, the term “jurisdiction” begins at the local level – a county, city, town, combination of jurisdictions, multiple counties or sub-state regions such as a Council of Governments or Homeland Security Region – as well as a state, tribe or territory. “Jurisdiction” also includes the private sector and any other NGO with responsibilities or interests in disaster management and resilience. Collaboration helps both public and private sector community stakeholders at all levels increase resilience. The models in this guide highlight interdependencies among businesses, industries, community organizations and government agencies. The models apply to both rural and urban jurisdictions. The recommendations help jurisdictions develop, manage and scale P3s to strengthen health and safety, economic security and community resilience. At the core, a P3 connects people, builds relationships and breaks down barriers so that representatives from private, nongovernmental and public organizations know each other prior to an incident affecting their jurisdiction.",

This process enabled the team to robustly identify the building blocks necessary to create and strengthen a digital ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders involved in the preparedness, response and recovery stages of humanitarian assistance. Three overarching themes emerged from the research and form the basis of this report, providing information on how to build that ecosystem:\n1. Developing Strategic Partnerships \n2. Shaping an enabling environment \n3. Building an ecosystem with users",
      "Key Recommendations": "Addressing barriers: \n1. Programming: Programming that explicitly addresses barriers is the most direct way of ensuring that users are equipped with the skills and tools they need to be digitally included – fully, safely and over the long term. The GSMA has supported local digital skills training for users to take full advantage of digital services.\n2. Integrating users in the process: A key part of building the digital ecosystem is ensuring user buy-in and long-term sustainability. The GSMA has worked alongside partners to guide human-centred design and co-creation approaches with end users. Including user perspectives as programmes are developed ensures their experiences are the starting point for any new services and programming.",

      "Key Findings": "Results imply that if farmer-led irrigation development were primarily financed through private investment (that is the farmers themselves make the investment), it disproportionately benefits wealthier farmers because land areas highly suitable for groundwater irrigation or solarised pumps\nare also home to wealthier households. (pg. 65)\n\nResults imply that if public and private sector investments for irrigation\ntechnology supply chains and services are targeted in areas with high suitability of natural resources (land and water), they will likely benefit the wealthier households and boost high-value as well as more water-intensive crop production. This, in combination with the lack of access to loans for irrigation technologies and in particular the barriers to female headed and marginal households, can deter the goals of food security and poverty reduction. (pg. 68)",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. First, policies aimed at facilitating farmer-led irrigation development using shallow groundwater resources (including off-grid solar pumps) might want to look beyond physical suitability of land and water resources. While irrigation suitability is a critical first step, it is equally important to consider socio-economic characteristics of households\nand communities to avoid elite capture as wealthier households tend to reside in areas of higher suitability to groundwater use in irrigation.\n2. Secondly, there is a need for combined public and private financing approaches to support the different needs of wealthier and resource-poor farmers, especially in areas where irrigation development is suitable. Whilst wealthier households would benefit from strengthened irrigation supply chain and services (for example, financial or repair services), improved market access and agricultural extension services through private sector investments, resource-poor households would require\ntailored financing mechanisms specific to bottom of the pyramid markets. These tailored financing mechanisms are often not financially viable or considered as high risk by the private sector. Hence, blended financing by donors or smart subsidy programmes by governments, carefully designed to not distort markets, and based on both irrigation suitability mapping and socio-economic status, would enhance marginal farmers’ access to irrigation in areas with high irrigation suitability.\n3. Third, strengthening of irrigation supply chains, financial and repair services should go hand in hand with incentives to stimulate high-value crops and staple food production in Ethiopia’s efforts towards climate, food, and nutrition security. Results show that aside from crop diversification, high-value fruit, vegetables and other cash crops are favoured by households investing in irrigation. Extra financing or subsidy schemes tailored to FLI to support staple food production and livestock value chains will be crucial going forward.",

For example, whereas previously it took two working days a week from three full-time staff to reconcile paper vouchers, it took our teams 75%–80% less time to process four times as many electronic vouchers. These findings validate our belief that technology has massive potential to increase the scale, efficiency, and effectiveness of humanitarian aid, and also pave the way for integrating technology more deeply and in more ways in our programming worldwide. \n",

      "Document Title": "Feed the Future Nigeria Agricultural Extension and Advisory Services Activity - Mapping to Markets (M2M) Report",
      "Key Findings": "• Based on various factors described in the M2M analysis, the Activity will focus its implementation in the five target commodities as follows:(a) Benue state for cowpea, rice and soybean; (b) Cross River for rice and aquaculture; (c) Delta state for aquaculture and maize; (d) Ebonyi state for maize and rice; (e) Kaduna state for cowpea, maize, and soybean; (f) Kebbi state for rice and soybean; and (g) Niger state for rice, maize and cowpea.\n\n• The main market channels have been identified for each target value chain and will be the primary focus of the Activity: artisanal rice processors (rice); local spot markets (maize and soybean); village market agents (cowpea); fresh fish (aquaculture).\n\n• The Most Impactful Practices that demonstrate the highest return on investment for smallholder farmers are: mechanized threshing (rice); improved seeds (rice, maize); mechanized land preparation (maize, soybean); pest-resistant varieties (cowpea); and fresh fish (aquaculture). Business case analyses demonstrate a range of 10% (for mechanized threshing in soybean) to 31% (for mechanized land preparation) increased profitability through the integration of the MIPs compared to traditional practices.\n\n• Provision of extension services to SHFs requires the use of more sustainable channels of value chain actors that recognize good relationships between SHFs and the various actors in the inputs, services, and advisory space. Except in Kebbi where the M2M did not identify any processors in soybean, there are large number of MSMEs in all the states. However, the MSMEs generally have limited skills to engage with smallholder farmers to sell their services. This will be an area of explicit focus for the Activity.\n\n• Several large companies (e.g., agro-chemical suppliers, seed companies, fertilizer distribution networks)\nare working within the target value chains. Many of these have large networks of MSMEs serving large\nnumbers of smallholder farmers within the target states. The Activity will engage a select group of these larger companies (and their associated MSMEs) in disseminating MIPs and expanding and improving service provision and reach to smallholder farmers.\n\n• The target states have good penetration of financial service providers – with two DFIs, 141 MFBs, seven depot money banks, as well as local money lenders, savings and credit associations, and mobile money agents operating within the ZOI. Due to the proximity and accessibility of MFBs and NBMFIs to SHFs, the Activity will target them for capacity building to expand their lending through business development training and credit guarantee services.\n\n• The M2M identified the four main channels for information dissemination – radio, video, mobile phone with SMS, IVR, WhatsApp message features, and NAERLS Farmers Helpline. Based on the findings on the preferences for various ICT channels in different parts of the ZOI, the Activity should prioritize the use of radio to disseminate business solutions and extension messaging to SHFs in Kaduna, Niger, and Kebbi states and should prioritize the use of phones in Delta, Cross River, Ebonyi, and Benue states.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- In the context of production volume, comparative advantage, contribution to the national output, and transaction volume for SHFs, the Activity should focus its implementation in the five target commodities as follows: (a) Benue state for cowpea, rice and soybean; (b) Cross River for rice and aquaculture; (c) Delta state for aquaculture and maize; (d) Ebonyi state for maize and rice; (e) Kaduna state for cowpea, maize, and soybean; (f) Kebbi state for rice and soybean; and (g) Niger state for rice, maize and cowpea.\n\n- During dry-season production, the Activity should focus its engagement with smallholder rice producers in Niger and Benue state, where greater production is taking place amongst the seven target states. \n\n- While the use of improved seeds has been identified as an MIP, access to quality seed by SHFs will require investment in community based seed multiplication involving research institutions, seed companies, and farmers. Agencies such as IITA, AERLS and SeedCo could collaborate in this regard to make improved seed available to SHFs. \n\n- Except in Kebbi where the M2M did not identify any processors in soybean, there are large number of MSMEs in all the states. The MSMEs generally have limited skills to engage with smallholder farmers to sell their services. The Activity should support them in establishing a dependable client base and creating a strong channel for extension messaging and commercialization of their services by building their capacity to address gaps and improve service delivery to SHFs.\n\n- The Activity should strategically engage the big actors in inputs services who have large network of MSMEs. This will aid effective delivery of timely inputs, services, and extension messaging to SHFs. To deal with large firms, the Activity should not take a state-by-state approach that isolates firms, rather it should leverage the inter-state nature of their business operations to facilitate MSME engagement. In this line, the Activity should leverage on the strength of their coverage and explore partnership with Jubaili in Niger, Kebbi, and Kaduna; Wacot in Cross River, Kebbi, Ebonyi, Niger, and Kaduna; Saro Agro in Kaduna, Kebbi, Niger, and Benue; and MultiChem in Niger, Kebbi, and Kaduna.",

      "Document Title": "TechnoServe Prosper Cashew Project Baseline Report",
      "Key Findings": "Prosper Cashew is targeting a significant increase in domestic processing with a goal of 50% of 2020 production. Barring some of the additional opportunities highlighted in this report, the project is well designed to support processors towards this ambitious goal, but the feasibility of reaching 50% in five\nyears is unlikely, given the wide range of challenges faced by West African processors.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. A version of the information contained in this baseline report is directly shared with all participating stakeholders, as the majority of stakeholders consulted demonstrated interest in receiving feedback/insights on this study.\n2. Prosper Cashew consider the feasibility of engaging with authorities and processors in supporting countries to mobilize processors and help strengthen their institutional presence to\nadvocate for their interests. There is also an opportunity to operationalize this approach by closely working on strategies with PRO-Cashew, but as discussed, the interests of producers, represented by PRO-Cashew, and processors, represented by Prosper Cashew, are not necessarily aligned. This involves looking beyond short-term incentives, where exporters generally pay higher price for RCN than processors, providing immediate incentives to reject any fiscal measures to promote privileged access to RCN by processors.\n3. A harmonized regulatory and institutional framework for the cashew value chain that incentivizes cashew processing in their respective countries be supported by TNS for all countries in the region, and notably the three project countries.\n4. Trainings remain flexible, aligning theory and practice and provided on a continuous basis to ensure maximum relevance. In line with this, there are important technological resources\navailable to develop good quality training materials for all processors, and even delivering some trainings virtually, such as the TNS high-quality blended learning online platform featuring some cashew processing materials already developed. This could be a good basis to consider for future delivery.\n5. Prosper Cashew considers the support of cashew by-products sale for food production. Confectionary, biscuits, paste, other processed foods, can all integrate the small but equally nutritious cashew pieces as ingredients in their recipes. Some processors are exploring cashew oil, cashew butter, and even cashew brandy (derived from the cashew apple) and secondary revenue generating product lines.\n6. Specific, targeted actions should be designed to ensure gender inequalities are addressed. Such activities could include requests that women be represented in capacity-building initiatives developed, and that specific targets be set for access to finance for women-owned processors. Additionally, the project should avoid making any negative “unintended” impact by increasing the gap between men and women or reinforcing gender discriminatory practices.\n7. Further investigation is undertaken to assess the possibility of working with not only medium- to large-sized processors, but also small-sized processors, as they often have a higher employee to unit RCN processed ratio, can potentially access the international markets, and are doing well in Ghana and Nigeria. Notably, approximately 40% to 45% of the cashew kernel produced in Brazil is processed by small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.\n8. Prosper Cashew consider supporting the supply of cashew nuts for organic, vegan and other sustainability markets (through certification), which are largely untapped and currently not part of the business strategy and product portfolio of most processors in Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and\nNigeria.\n9. Prosper Cashew reassesses the target of 50% in country processing for the ultimate outcome indicator.\n10. Prosper Cashew take into consideration all points mentioned in Section 5 - Monitoring and Evaluation Considerations.\n11. Prosper Cashew consider undertaking a study of the cashew sector in Brazil.\n12. Prosper Cashew consider undertaking a study of child labor in the cashew sector. This should not only be of processors, but of other relevant segments of the value chain (e.g., exporters, intermediaries, and producers, etc.). Prosper Cashew could do this in collaboration with PRO- cashew, as well other NGOs such as UNICEF, the International Labor Organization, or the Sustainable Trade Initiative, and relevant Government agencies. Subsequently, letters of commitment or codes of conduct could be developed and signed by relevant parties.",

Although government has resorted to several financial stimulus measures for helping MSMEs more needs to be done. The need of the hour is using latest modern technology in addition to marketing schemes to provide assistance to MSMEs. With the onset of globalization, technology is increasingly becoming indispensable as a vital tool for MSMEs to improve their productivity and efficiency. A strong technology enabled sector has the potential to become a global player. The role of technology in the form of social media, e-commerce platforms, cloud computing have the potential to unleash great value and opportunity. Lastly, higher adoption of digital technology is expected especially after the pandemic. \n- Amazon had announced the 'Spotlight North East' programme (US$ 25 million) in April 2021. The aim of the programme provided an online funding to 50,000 artisans, weavers and small industries from the Northeast by 2025. In addition to this, the other goals are to boost exports of important supplies such as tea, spices and honey. \n-ICICI Bank introduced the 'Merchant Stack' programme in April, 2021. This is a complete digital banking services that is predominantly aimed at retail traders. In addition, people using this service can take advantage of contactless services (InstaBIZ). \n-Vedanta Limited, a leading producer of metals and oil & gas, launched the “Vedanta Saathi' programme. The aim of the programme is to provide financial assistance for MSMEs to set up new manufacturing units near it. \n-Walmart's Vriddhi programme has been stretched to Uttar Pradesh on February 2021. It is expected to profit 50,000 MSMEs across the nation. \n-Mastercard and Razorpay merged in February, 2021 to benefit small Indian businesses to adapt digital payments. Lastly, Bank of Maharashtra cooperated with Vayana Network, to bring financial assistance to MSMEs. \n",

It found that the riverine island dwellers are facing the worst impacts of climate change, and thus this study examines climate finance governance and its effect on disaster management in these areas. These dwellers are experiencing a poverty trap due to the lack of food, riverbank erosion, crop pest infestation, and drought and are left to migrate because NGOs are not currently active in the area. The study advises, “...riverine island-based climate change management projects should be implemented through an effective monitoring system so that dwellers can benefit from it. Continuous development initiatives should be taken by the government with NGOs for proper implementation of climate finance projects since natural disasters are common in the locality.” It also recommends that Bangladesh should look into getting funding from the Green Climate Fund, in order to recover from the damages that have been caused and to assist in ending the poverty trap. \n",
      "Key Findings": "The study reveals that there is no direct contribution of climate finance governance in the village level. The char dwellers are facing so much misery due to climate change in every season likes two to three times food inundation, riverbank erosion, drought, crop pest infestation, etc. Some non-government organizations (NGOs) and government organizations (GOs) did work there till 2012 to transfer some assets like cattle, monthly stipend, raising plinths for food protection, subsidies for water sources and sanitary latrines. But at present, their existence/activities are not reported active. But climate change impacts hinder their livelihoods and damage their assets in a regular basis. They have no other option to live mainland or migrate to better places due to chronic poverty trap.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The study suggests that riverine island-based climate change management project should be implemented through efective monitoring system so that char dwellers can get beneft from it. Continuous development initiative should be taken by the government with NGOs for proper implementation of climate fnance project since natural disasters are common in the locality. The government of Bangladesh should be taken initiative to Warsaw International Mechanism which helps to\npursue funding from international development organizations for recovering the loss and damage issues and get Green Climate Fund for protecting the char and coastal areas of Bangladesh. River governance, dam construction, protection of river erosion, food shelter construction, transferring climate-smart agricultural technology, social forestry and proper training on disaster management are the priority issues where climate fnance governance can contribute a lot and improve the food security and livelihood resilience of the char people.",

      "Key Findings": "Our study highlighted the roles that universities and the private sector played in response to COVID-19. These included augmenting Colombia’s clinical capacity and laboratory testing capacity, providing evidence to inform public health decision-making in response to unfolding events, coordinating actors from different sectors to address common issues, and extending networks and skills to support actions for community reach, technology development, and logistics. Even though Bogotá, Cali, and Cartagena differ in their population, the size of their territory, and in their installed network of health providers and universities (with Bogotá the largest and Cartagena the smallest of the three), we found that in the three cases academic institutions and the private sector played similar roles.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This study showed that intersectoral coordination has played an important role in responding to COVID-19 in Colombia. Coordination was influenced by substantive and situational enablers and barriers. Based on our findings, policy-makers should focus on addressing substantive barriers to coordination, including the pre-existing tensions and mistrust among national and local healthcare actors, strict regulations and limited financial and human resources, while providing support for situational enablers, including alignment of public and private actors’ interests, intersectoral government support and establishing frequent communication channels and formal spaces of interaction among sector, in processes of decision-making.\nFurther qualitative research is needed that includes the perspective of frontline staff on intersectoral working in response to COVID-19. Such work might examine the potential impact on the well-being of rank-and-file staff in universities associated with responding to COVID-19, to see how this compares to the impact on those involved on the front-line in the delivery of health services, for example, stress and burnout in both sectors have been reported.

      "Document Title": "Primer on Private Sector Engagement in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations",
      "Key Findings": "Adding a Third Dimension to Shared Value:\nThe preferred approach to engaging the private sector, across contexts, is by advancing shared value where development objectives intersect with core business interests. In FCS, we must apply a third layer of intersection to ensure a partnership or alliance also aligns with principles such as Do No Harm and Conflict Sensitivity to foster stability and resilience.\n\nNot All Companies are Alike:\nIn FCS, the private sector can serve as a bulwark against chaos by contributing many positive attributes necessary for stability such as jobs, tax revenue, and the provision of essential goods and services. Most businesses typically thrive in more stable environments ---characterized by transparency and accountability. However, some private sector actors perform better in chaos and are able to maintain a privileged position by participating in entrenched patterns of corruption, advancing their own special interests at the expense of the collective good. Understanding each private sector actor’s role in the system, as well as any potential embedded relationships (to the greatest extent possible within the context of imperfect information), is essential to making the right decisions around how and with whom to. engage. Selecting partners whose interests align with peace and stability is key to encouraging inclusivity and fairness rather than further enforcing behaviors or actions that exacerbate inequalities and conflict.\n\nPSE Best Practice is More Important than Ever in FCS:\nA PSE best practice, across all contexts, is to conduct upfront prospecting, or opportunity identification, ahead of selecting partners and areas of collaboration. This upfront prospecting is essential to understanding individual companies’ role in the system and by extension who the most strategic and impactful set of partners might be to USAID. \nGood prospecting will reveal companies’ interests and incentives to enter into partnership, which will help development practitioners effectively co-create partnership design with their company counterparts in a way that drives forward shared value. Insights revealed through prospecting will also help USAID and IPs to understand whether they can offer additionality—whether or not they are uniquely positioned to unlock constraints to private sector involvement and investment in an area that advances development objectives.\nIn FCS, upfront prospecting is more important than ever to understand opportunities, challenges, and how to engage appropriately. Though there will be pressure for siloed fast action in these contexts, short-circuiting essential upfront analysis can expose USAID to significant risk in unknowingly engaging with bad actors, which could ultimately exacerbate inequalities and conflict. Conducting due diligence to thoroughly vet potential partners ahead of engagement is therefore critical.\nA cornerstone of prospecting, or strategic positioning, in FCS will be applying a conflict sensitivity lens to begin to map conflict dynamics and stakeholders within a country or locale. Though it would take trusted local sources (which can take years to establish) to navigate the complex web of incentive structures between interconnected market actors, in the broadest terms, this mapping can help to reveal companies whose interests are aligned with stability versus those whose interests are aligned with chaos.\nEngaging companies that adhere to transparent, accountable, fair, and socially inclusive business practices can elevate standards of engagement for all players–taking the first steps towards forming the foundations of a functioning market system. Prospecting can reveal whether potential corporate partners are motivated by philanthropic or profit interests. Philanthropically oriented partnerships that make a meaningful contribution will be few and far between and will tend to be concentrated in humanitarian contexts in order to provide immediate access to essential goods and services.\n\nGetting Beyond Financial Support:\nThere is a clear need for USAID and its implementing partners to shift away from contributing only, or primarily, financial support, to also accompanying their private sector partners throughout engagement in navigating these environments to gain access to human capital, data, information, and infrastructure. USAID and IPs have a key role to play in brokering relationships with other essential market actors, including peer firms, government, civil society, and other donors or development actors. USAID and IPs can also accompany firm partners in problem solving and unlocking constraints throughout partnership implementation, leveraging their convening power when necessary and appropriate to draw other key actors into dialogue or action. By shifting into this active, facilitative and accompaniment role, USAID and IPs can add value by acting as catalysts for positive change; as facilitators of constructive, peace promoting activities; as key contributors to an enabling environment that supports stability; and as influencers of stability.",

It does this by answering  key questions for each of the documents that include: What is the problem and overall solution?;  How does the model work?; What is the donor role;  How did the donor role create additionality?; What are climate impacts?; What are the realized or expected human impacts?; and  What are lessons learned that supported increased speed and scale of climate action? By answering these questions, this document found that catalyzing private sector finance for climate action is pivotal for limiting global warming and blending finance can catalyze private sector investment that allows donors and commercial capital providers to “invest alongside one another to increase the speed and scale of climate solutions.” \n",
      "Key Findings": "Catalyzing private finance for climate action is essential to achieving goals for limiting global warming. Global climate financing currently available is insufficient to meet the minimum USD 1.6 trillion annual target needed to keep warming within the 1.5-2°C range.\nUSAID seeks to play a pivotal role in climate action, increasing funding to partner countries and reducing global emissions by half by 2030.\nBlended finance can catalyze private sector investment for climate action with financial structuring that enables impact-oriented donors and commercial capital providers to invest alongside each other to increase the speed and scale of climate solutions.",

      "Key Findings": "Key Takeaways:\n• Conflict sensitivity is an obligation and a commitment to Do No Harm that CBi Member Networks must consider in their disaster management interventions before, during and after crises.\n• Initiatives and interventions that adopt a conflict-sensitive approach are more effective, and help to strengthen social cohesion.\n• To be conflict sensitive, CBi Member Networks and other private sector stakeholders need to actively assess and monitor the potential impacts of their activities on different groups, and make adjustments to \nmitigate risks and strengthen local capacities for social cohesion.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommended actions and key points to consider\n1. Understand the context:  Assess the context (national, local or other) in which you operate, ideally in partnership with others; Identify potential high-risk sectors and/or companies to pay heightened attention to; Gather and share lessons learned on how companies gather information on the context through political risk \nanalysis, environmental and social impact assessments, supply chain assessments, etc.\n2. Assess your intervention against the context:  Dedicate sufficient time to reflect how the network’s programming could have an impact – intended or unintended – on different groups and on existing tensions \nwithin communities; Conduct due diligence on member companies (if and as possible) and/or ask if partners have already conducted due diligence on them; Encourage companies to sign on to the UN Global Compact Ten Principles (and ask why not if they are not \nwilling).\n3. Adjust your operations if and as needed: Identify the key risks and potential mitigation measures; If necessary, adjust your operations to deliver the intended outcome; Provide a feedback mechanism and take corrective action if complaints are raised by any stakeholder group; In circumstances where it is impossible to be completely conflict sensitive, the network and its partners need to weigh the potential benefits against the harm of implementing the intervention (tradeoffs).",

      "Key Findings": "The results from Koh Tao provide clear evidence that most of the sampled accommodation businesses are negatively affected by impacts that are commonly related to or exacerbated by climate change. Climate change related risks, however, are not perceived as posing the biggest threat to their businesses. This discernment conflicts with the fact that most sampled businesses already do implement measures that can, in theory, be labeled as being adaptation action. It is, therefore, possible to argue that the respondents recognize climate change in their investment decisions, although it appears to be a rather reactive and unconscious form of recognition. The existing recognition and related investments also lead to the conclusion that the accommodation owner-managers have a clear interest to address business risks, including those posed by climate change. The private sector (accommodation suppliers) itself, however, likely do not bother how actions that reduce their business risks in regard to natural hazards are being labeled. The findings also show that adaptation behavior of accommodation suppliers appears to be influenced by power dynamics on Koh Tao. There is a concentration of power among a few families, which can hinder a sustainable and climate risk-informed development pathway and investment decisions of individual accommodation businesses.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Future research should, therefore, consider and investigate more differentiated forms (passive, reactive, and anticipatory) of private sector adaptation. Building up on this study, an assessment of the relation between adaptation action of tourism industry stakeholders and governmental climate change adaptation planning and budgeting processes could, furthermore, provide policy-relevant findings indicating whether advanced government-led climate change response frameworks affect the strategic investment decisions (consciously or not) of tourism industry stakeholders.",

      "Document Summary": "This document examines climate finance potential and policy barriers regarding renewable energy and energy efficiency in Sub-Saharan Africa. Due to population growth, urbanization and economic growth,  clean energy is needed in Sub-Saharan Africa for a better future. This paper examines the potential for renewable and energy-efficient energy sources, by analyzing five investment indicators. It also examines the policy barriers in Sub-Saharan Africa that could hinder the expansion of climate friendly energy. The document found that there is a great investment potential, especially with new technologies; the climate issues need to be addressed in a systematic way that treats it as a development issue; policy needs to be improved to scale-up public funding; and the government needs to close the climate finance gap that is necessary for sustainable development. ",
      "Key Findings": "Drawing on MTP and against a broader background of climate finance, this paper quantified the climate investment potential in renewable energy and energy efficiency in select SSA countries. From the review, it emerges there is vast climate finance investment potential for the private sector in SSA, particularly with the deployment of RE and E.E. technologies. As such, countries need to treat climate change as a development issue that needs to be addressed systematically in their respective development strategies and policies. An approach that\nis envisioned to translate into low carbon development as well as\npromoting resource use efficiency and increase private investments.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1) There is substantial climate finance investment potential for the private sector in SSA, particularly for deploying RE and EE technologies.\n2) Countries need to treat climate change as a development issue that needs to be addressed systematically in their respective development strategies and policies.\n3) Improved policy and regulatory environment are paramount in scaling up public funding and attracting private sector climate-resilient investments.\n4) Government needs to create significant synergies with the private sector to close the climate finance gap necessary for sustainable development.",

      "Document Summary": "The 2021 Global Landscape of Climate Finance analyzes climate finance flows along their life cycle. First, it examines the sources and intermediaries of finance, followed by the instruments used and the purposes and sectors served. It then presents the geographic profile of climate finance flows, before concluding with a discussion of the current outlook for global climate finance and ways to improve tracking practices in the future.",
      "Key Findings": "Total climate finance has steadily increased over the last decade, reaching USD 632 billion in 2019/2020, but flows have slowed in the last few years. This is a worrying trend given that COVID-19’s impact on climate finance is yet to be fully observed. The increase in annual climate finance flows between 2017/2018 and 2019/2020 was only 10% compared to previous periods, when it grew more than 24%.\n\nAn increase of at least 590% in annual climate finance is required to meet internationally agreed climate objectives by 2030 and to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change.\n\nAdaptation finance continues to lag. Finance for adaptation increased by 53% reaching USD 46 billion in 2019/2020 compared to USD 30 billion in 2017/2018. Despite this positive trend, total adaptation finance remains far below the scale necessary to respond to existing and future climate change. \n\nPublic climate finance increased by 7% from 2017/2018, remaining largely stable at 51% (USD 321 billion) of the total. \n\nPrivate climate investments increased by 13% from 2017/2018, to USD 310 billion. \n\nThe majority of climate finance — 61% (USD 384 billion) — was raised as debt, of which 12% (USD 47 billion) was low-cost or concessional debt. \n\nSolar PV and onshore wind continued to be the main recipient of renewable energy finance, attracting over 91% of all mitigation investment. Renewables were primarily financed through private capital, reflecting the sector’s growing commercial viability.\n\nLow-carbon transport is the fastest-growing sector, with an average increase of 23% compared to 2017/2018. \n\nMitigation investment in hard-to-decarbonize sectors remained low, partly attributed to limited data availability. \n\nMore than 75% of 2019/2020 tracked climate investments flowed domestically. Around USD 479 billion of climate investments was raised and spent within the same country, highlighting the continued importance of strengthening national policies, public finance systems, and domestic regulatory frameworks to encourage investments and address risk.\n\nThree-quarters of global climate investments were concentrated in East Asia & Pacific, Western Europe, and North America, while the remaining regions received less than a quarter. \n\nClimate investment in the economically advanced regions of Western Europe, United States & Canada, and Oceania were primarily funded by private finance, while other regions sourced their climate investments mostly from public sources.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Climate finance flows are nowhere near estimated needs, conservatively estimated at USD 4.5 – 5 trillion annually. To achieve the transition to a sustainable, net zero emissions, and resilient world this decade, climate investment must increase drastically. \n\nFilling the investment gap for adaptation is critical to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Finance to adaptation, from both public and private actors, must be scaled by orders of magnitude to respond to current and oncoming climate risks. Information on investment in adaptation must also improve.\n\nImproved and standardized definitions, methodologies, and data access are key to inform necessary climate investment decisions. \n\nWe need credible and coordinated monitoring of commitments, with clear transition plans that include interim goals. Achieving net zero by 2050 will require all public and private actors to align not only investment, but also practices, business models, and portfolios with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and increasing resilience to a changing climate. \n\nWider and better reporting on the interlinkages between climate finance and other sustainable development goals (SDGs) can help facilitate assessments of progress towards a just and sustainable transition.

      "Key Findings": "The private sector plays a large role in malaria treatment provision in Nigeria. To improve access to, and affordability of, quality-assured artemisinin-based combination therapy (QA-ACT) within this sector, the Affordable Medicines Facility-Malaria began operations in 2010 and transitioned to a private sector co-payment mechanism (PSCM) until 2017. To assess the impact of the scheme on the ACT market, cross-sectional household and outlet surveys were conducted in 2018 to coincide with the final stockages of ACT medicines procured under the PSCM.\n\nThe subsidy scheme does appear to have had a signifcant impact on improving availability and affordability of ACT and this is twinned with high consumer demand for malaria treatment from private outlets, particularly among PPMVs. As well as having direct impact through supply of the green leaf brands, the scheme has had indirect effects on the market as a whole, through increasing competition and market share of other, non-green leaf brands. With the end of the subsidy scheme, increased competition for market share can be expected and steps\nneed to be taken to ensure these competing brands are of a high quality, and that the market is kept free of sub-standard and falsifed ACT medicines, and AMT medicines. As well as methods to aid QA-testing of new and existing products, regular monitoring of the post-subsidy, open market is needed such as that seen with bed net distribution programmes and in agriculture.",

      "Document Summary": "This case study examines the relationship between the IFC, McCormick and Company, and CITIbank in Vietnam and Indonesia. Specifically the study looks at the black pepper supply chain and how they can provide discounted rates while improving their environmental and social performances. The financial partnership aims to expand the emerging markets that McCormick can invest in. The study found: “ The benefits of Supplier Finance (“SF”) as an innovative financing tool to promote responsible investment by both domestic small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and multinational corporations (MNCs)” and “The need for an enabling framework in emerging markets to increase demand for this type of financing.” It also looks at the long-term sustainability of the investment to see the impact it has on social and environmental performance and found that differential pricing mechanisms could be beneficial. The study recommends that future investments look into utilizing supplier financing for low-carbon investment plans. \n",
      "Key Findings": "1) Investment allows suppliers receive an earlier payment than the contractually agreed payment, which typically takes from 30 to 180 days. Since the discount rate offered by the GTSF is calculated based on the credit profile of McCormick, it can lower Suppliers’ cost of capital by 25-50 basis points, in addition to the difference in local interest rates in Viet Nam vs. interest rates in the US. It also helps to increase the resiliency of the smallholder farmers that grow their key herbs and spices.\n2) Investment helps McCormick reach its Purpose-led Performance Goals by financially incentivizing its Suppliers for improvements in their sustainability performance as determined by McCormick. It also improve McCormick’s performance through more efficient supply chains.\n3) Investments enabled the financial institution to provide support to SME suppliers that could not be reached directly. For example, not many SMEs can borrow money directly from IFC. At the same time, the initiative demonstrates the benefits of supplier finance in emerging markets.\n4) The benefits of Supplier Finance (“SF”) as an innovative financing tool to promoteresponsible investment by both domestic small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and multinational corporations (MNCs)\n5) The need for an enabling framework in emerging markets to increase demand for this type of financing.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Businesses need financing either for investment or as working\ncapital for daily operations. Thus, access to suitable instruments\nto manage working capital requirements is key in global efforts to\nreduce the finance gap, particularly for small and medium-sized\nenterprises.\nSF products have the potential to improve the prospects for entrepreneurs who are held back by a lack of fixed collateral and limited offerings of appropriate credit products by financial institutions. Due to its unique structure, SF enables suppliers to larger global buyers to receive faster payment of invoices raised via a finance facility that is supported by using the creditworthiness and the strength of the buyer’s business as security for the lender, making it a win-win situation for all parties.\nStill, IFC noted that financial institutions in many emerging economies find it challenging to offer these products due to a lack of financial infrastructure, technological capacity, resources, and awareness. Regulators and policymakers in emerging countries should develop the enabling framework to increase demand for this type of funding.",

      "Document Summary": "This document examines how private sector investment and creativity is needed to help solve the global food security crisis. Currently pay- for-result schemes are used to catalyze private sector investment. In these schemes, development organizations give prizes to the private sector for achieving pre-specified goals. This document looks at the successful and failed pay-for-result schemes to give advice to the private sector. The lessons that were learned include: “structuring the prize to encourage the creation of competitive agricultural markets; aligning the prize structure with the development goal of improving smallholder farmers’ food security; and constructing a theory of change that reflects a thorough understanding of the baseline market, enabling environment, and underlying assumptions about competitors’ response to the prize.” These findings show how private sector investment can help global food security. ",
      "Key Findings": "The lessons highlighted from these examples illustrate the importance of structuring the prize to encourage the creation of competitive agricultural markets; aligning the prize structure with the development goal of improving smallholder farmers’ food security; and constructing a theory of change that refects a thorough understanding of the baseline market, enabling environment, and underlying assumptions about competitors’ response to the prize.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Under certain conditions, pay-for-results mechanisms can help develop competitive, smallholder-inclusive agricultural markets and reduce food insecurity.\n• Prize competitions ofering multiyear, proportional prizes are more conducive than grand prizes to fostering the development of competitive agricultural markets.\n• Te enabling environment plays a signifcant role in pay-for-results mechanisms’ success or failure.\n• Private sector-led actions alone may not be sufcient to adequately address the targeted development challenge.",

      "Document Summary": "The fifth Biennial Assessment (BA) conducted by the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) provides an updated overview of climate finance flows up until 2020, highlighting the trends therein, and an assessment of the implications of these flows for international efforts to address climate change. The fifth BA includes: \n\n(a) Information on recent developments in methodologies related to the tracking of climate finance at the international and domestic level, the operational definitions of climate finance in use, and the indicators for measuring the impacts of climate finance as well as emerging methodologies that support tracking the consistency of finance flows; \n(b) An overview of climate finance flows from developed to developing countries, and available information on domestic climate finance, cooperation among developing countries and other climate-related finance flows that constitute global climate finance; \n(c) An assessment of the key features of climate finance flows, including their composition and purpose; an exploration of the effectiveness, accessibility and magnitude (in the context of broader flows) of climate finance flows; and insights into country ownership and alignment of climate finance flows with the needs and priorities of beneficiaries. ",
      "Key Findings": "Methodological issues related to transparency of climate finance:\n1. New reporting tables will improve the information on climate finance submitted by Parties. \n2. The coverage and granularity of reporting on climate finance received by non-Annex I Parties is improving. \n3. Systems to track domestic public climate finance are growing in both developed and developing countries. \n4. Renewable energy, CCU/S, electrified transport, energy efficiency of buildings, and water management and supply are the most common mitigation activities listed across international, regional and national taxonomies or classifications. \n5. Climate finance providers are advancing more indicators and metrics to measure what climate finance is achieving on the ground.\n6. Increasing efforts are being made to enhance the transparency and comparability of approaches for tracking consistency with low-emission and climate-resilient development pathways. \n\nOverview of climate finance flows  in 2019–2020:\n1. Global climate finance flows were 12 per cent higher in 2019–2020 than in 2017–2018, reaching an annual average of USD 803 billion, with the trend being driven by an increasing number of mitigation actions in buildings and infrastructure and in sustainable transport, as well as by growth in adaptation finance.\n2. The continued decline in renewable energy technology costs in 2019–2020 compared with those in 2017–2018 meant that renewable energy investments, despite the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, remained close to the record high in 2017.\n3. Government pandemic recovery packages included up to USD 513 billion of spending allocated to green or climate-related measures (21 per cent of the total USD 2.5 trillion) up until the end of 2020. \n4. Public climate finance flows from developed to developing countries increased by between 6 and 17 per cent, depending on the source, in 2019–2020 compared with 2017–2018.\n5. Mitigation finance constituted the largest share of climate-specific financial support through bilateral, regional and other channels, at 57 per cent (USD 17.9 billion).\n6. UNFCCC funds and multilateral climate funds approved a combined USD 2.9 billion and USD 3.5 billion for climate change projects in 2019 and 2020 respectively.\n7. MDBs provided USD 46 billion and USD 45 billion in climate finance to developing and emerging economies in 2019 and 2020 respectively. \n8. Data on private climate finance flows to developing countries remain challenging to compile and assess. \n9. The increase in submissions of BURs from non-Annex I Parties resulted in a greater amount of information on finance being available for the fifth BA than for previous BAs. \n10. Trends in South-South climate finance flows varied depending on the source of finance. \n\n Assessment of climate finance flows:\n1. The collective goal of jointly mobilizing  USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation was not fully met in 2020.\n2. More public finance flows from developed to developing countries are for mitigation than for adaptation, yet adaptation finance has grown significantly through bilateral channels and MDBs. \n3. Public adaptation finance is predominantly delivered through grants while public mitigation f finance predominantly takes the form of loans.\n4. Reflecting their geographical and population sizes, Asia and Africa are the regions receiving the largest total amounts of public climate finance.  \n5. Support provided to the LDCs and SIDS as a proportion of overall public climate finance flows remained relatively stable compared with previous years. \n6. In 2019–2020, funding provided to the SIDS accounted for 3 percent of bilateral flows, 7 percent of approvals from multilateral climate funds and 2 percent of MDB climate finance.\n7. Between 2016 and 2020, private climate finance mobilized by developed countries for developing countries through bilateral and multilateral channels totalled USD 66.8 billion.\n8. Accreditation to multilateral climate funds increased by 36 percent in 2019–2020, driven by a rising number of national and regional institutions being accredited; however, while national and regional accredited entities now account for more than half of all accredited entities, they accounted for only 10 percent of financial outflows in 2019–2020. \n9. Interest in country platforms that facilitate country ownership of climate finance flows and their alignment with national priorities is emerging. \n10. Reported expected and actual results from climate finance providers indicate an increase in portfolio-level emission reductions and number of beneficiaries reached.\n11. The way in which gender issues are addressed under the governance and operational frameworks of the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism and multilateral climate funds has improved.\n12. Global climate finance flows are small relative to the overall needs of developing countries. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations on methodological issues related to climate finance flows are as follows: \n(a) Encourage Parties to report on climate finance provided, mobilized, needed and received in the new common tabular format for their first biennial transparency report to the highest level of granularity possible; \n(b) Encourage Parties to adopt or follow green- and climate-budgeting approaches and improve or establish climate finance tracking systems at the domestic level to inform their implementation of nationally determined contributions and adaptation communications; \n(c) Encourage climate finance providers and recipients to report climate finance provided, mobilized, needed and received at both the activity- and the country-level; \n(d) Encourage climate finance and data providers to further improve the data and the methodologies necessary for tracking private finance mobilized by developed countries, and others in a position to do so, through technical assistance, policy support and other public interventions for climate action in developing countries; \n(e) Encourage Parties and climate finance providers to enhance their methodologies for measuring and reporting on climate finance results and impacts; \n(f) Encourage Parties and climate finance providers to enhance their reporting on the qualitative aspects of climate finance, including policies, approaches and other factors related to strong enabling environments and delivering results; \n(g) Encourage Parties through the enhanced transparency framework and taking into account the work of the SCF on definitions of climate finance, to better track climate finance provided, mobilized, needed and received;\n(h) Encourage climate finance providers and data aggregators, in keeping with social inclusion and the potential value of information and data from the informal private sector and from local and indigenous communities, as well as noting the usefulness of proxy data, to incorporate into their systems the tracking of climate finance flows and impacts relating to these stakeholders;\n(i) Encourage climate finance providers to enhance their reporting on elements relevant to Article 2, paragraph 1(c), of the Paris Agreement, thus increasing the ability to advance work related to pathways for low-emission, climate-resilient development.\n\nAdditional recommendations on the overview and assessment of climate finance flows are also outlined in the full report.",

      "Document Summary": "This report is mandated through decision 4/CP.26, paragraph 19, whereby the COP requested the SCF to prepare a report in 2022 on progress towards achieving the goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, taking into account the Climate Finance Delivery Plan and other relevant reports, for consideration by COP 27, and to continue to contribute to assessing the achievement of the goal in the context of the preparation of its biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows. ",
      "Key Findings": "Although mandated as a collective goal, several reports by non-Party stakeholders highlight the lack of burden sharing framework among developed countries as a challenge to hold individual developed countries accountable for shortfalls in achieving the goal. The studies find approximately seven countries out of 24 Annex II Parties, consistently meet their “fair share” of climate finance provision according to different indices and methods (Bos and Thwaites, 2021; Colenbrander et al., 2022; Colenbrander et al., 2021). \nA key challenge, as noted in various sources of information, is mobilization of private finance from public interventions (COP26, 2021; Bhattacharya et al., 2020).\nThe IPCC AR6 identified slowing and unstable GDP growth due to worsening climate impacts such as greater and rising intensity of floods, droughts, forest fires and storms, that raise private financing costs and deteriorating public fiscal positions and rising indebtedness as headwinds already affecting climate finance flows before 2020. The disruption of COVID-19 and global energy and food supply shocks has further exacerbated these challenges with public finance reallocated to pandemic relief and economic recovery measures.\n\nAdditional findings explored included challenges and lessons learned to ensure mobilization addresses the needs of developing countries (i.e., aspects related to data and reporting quality, access to finance), in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation, and in measuring progress to support implementation of the goal.",

      "Document Summary": "This document examines the impact of carbon pricing, climate financing, and financial literacy on COVID-19 cases. It shows that green climate policies help the COVID-19 pandemic in a positive way. The study does this by evaluating the cross-sectional panel of 43 nations in regards to climate funding, financial literacy, and carbon pricing in lowering exposure to coronavirus cases. The report gave three recommendations for countries to consider based on its findings: 1) Climate financing is a green effort for air pollution reduction; 2) Imposing a tax on polluting output is deemed beneficial to enhance environmental quality via carbon reduction; and 3) Financial literacy acts as a knowledge spillover, allowing for the development of policies to broaden the base of climate finance and the application of carbon taxes on polluting industries.",
      "Key Findings": "The fndings indicate that climate fnance signifcantly reduces coronavirus exposure by introducing green fnancing initiatives that beneft human health, which eventually strengthens the immune system’s ability to fght infectious illnesses. Financial literacy and carbon pricing, on the other hand, are inefectual in controlling coronavirus infections due to rising economic activity and densely inhabited areas that enable the transmission of coronavirus cases across countries. Similar fndings were obtained using the alternative regression apparatus. The COVID-19 predicted variable was used as a “response variable,” and climate fnancing was shown to have a favorable impact on containing coronavirus exposure. As shown by the innovation accounting matrix, carbon pricing would drastically decrease coronavirus cases’ exposure over a time horizon. The study concludes that climate fnance and carbon pricing were critical in improving air quality indicators, which improved countries’ health and wealth, allowing them to reduce coronavirus infections via sustainable healthcare reforms.",
      "Key Recommendations": "i) Climate financing is a green effort for air pollution reduction. Carbon emissions are the primary cause of environmental degradation, which has a detrimental efect on human health. Unhealthy individuals are more prone to infection by infectious illnesses, including COVID-19. Therefore, there is a more considerable need to enhance climate fnance to explore green energy sources and improve energy efciency. Renewable energy sources are considered environmentally and humane, advancing the global sustainability agenda for healthcare.\nii) Imposing a tax on polluting output is deemed benefcial to enhance environmental quality via carbon reduction. Carbon pricing is a regulation choice made by the government to rein in pollution levels, which ultimately improves the healthcare agenda. Coronavirus is a fatal illness likely to spread by photochemical smog and fuel combustion; thus, it is critical to improving air quality standards to avoid infectious diseases.\niii) Financial literacy acts as a knowledge spillover, allowing for the development of policies to broaden the base of climate fnance and the application of carbon taxes on polluting industries. Making the appropriate investment in cleaner production technologies is only achievable with knowledge of green finance instruments that help attain the healthcare sustainability goal. It is desirable to invest in sustainable healthcare technology in order to limit coronavirus cases on a worldwide scale.",

According to the triple helix model and the national innovation system approach, in today’s global economy, HEICs are key to a country’s development because they drive the production and flow of knowledge, technology, information, and skills through the interaction of the public, private, and education sectors. For HEIs, HEICs can provide financial support for educational, research, and service missions; enhance the experience and expertise of their students and faculty; increase employment opportunities for students; and boost regional economic development. And, although implementing HEICs may present challenges, collaborations can be successful if proactive steps are taken to mitigate the risks.",

      "Key Findings": "- The main barriers the surveyed entrepreneurs face are related to a lack of government support, high operating and logistical costs, and employment formalization.\n-Private social investment represents an important source of resources for PDET municipalities and other municipalities prioritized by USAID/Colombia to implement projects related to economic reactivation and agricultural production, rural education and early childhood, and health. According to the IISP, in 2020, PSI in PDET municipalities was made by 63 large companies and reached $ 121.6 million. However, most of this investment (46.5 percent) is concentrated in the PDET regions of Antioquia, Cauca, Caquetá, and Bolívar.\n-The 20 case studies show that the private sector is making productive and social investments in the territories that favor vulnerable populations. In the PDET municipalities, the investment of these companies is concentrated in education, community training, infrastructure development, and environmental conservation.\n-The interest in educational issues involving children, adolescents, and young people is based on a vision of development that promotes the generation of skills in people and the training of human talent so companies can have qualified workers to carry out their productive activities in the territories.\n-Strategies such as public-private partnerships and Colombia’s works for taxes scheme denote a fertile field for the improvement of investment business processes and the implementation of sustainability strategies in PDET regions. These processes are long term and require joint intervention strategies in the territory with different actors.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• USAID/Colombia should consider maintaining and promoting relationship mechanisms with local institutions, such as chambers of commerce and regional National Training Service offices.\n• USAID/Colombia should consider companies from the manufacturing, financial, trade, and mining and quarry industries as potential partners in prioritized territories.\n• Within territories prioritized by USAID/Colombia, the USAID Mission should consider promoting mobilization of resources to territories that currently have lower PSIs.\n• USAID/Colombia should consider designing and implement a dissemination plan of its private sector engagement strategy for companies. This would allow greater participation by companies in alliance models promoted by the USAID Mission.\n• USAID/Colombia should consider supporting the structuring of projects by local governments to be included in the Colombia’s Works for Taxes scheme project bank, and for companies to execute these projects through this mechanism.\n• USAID/Colombia should consider offering a support and assistance program for the design and strategic planning of company sustainability portfolios.\n• USAID/Colombia should consider studying the agreements in social and environmental issues and in the licenses for energy, port, and infrastructure projects. Following this analysis, USAID/Colombia should consider supporting mandatory social investment processes, environmental mitigation efforts, and compensation measures, with the goal of ensuring compliance and, wherever possible, increasing impacts.",

      "Document Title": "Climate Finance Effectiveness: A Comparative Analysis of Geothermal Development in Indonesia and the Philippines",
      "Document Summary": "This article investigates climate finance effectiveness in geothermal development in the Philippines and Indonesia. It looks at how domestic policies impact the effectiveness of international agencies. It found that there are three key climate finance mechanisms: utility modifier, social learning and capacity building. These mechanisms work independently and impact the barriers of entry into geothermal development. The report found that the utility modifier mechanism was the most impactful form of aid, but is not self sufficient. The findings suggest that policy changes need to be made to support climate finance and it is necessary to have political will in favor of prioritizing renewable energy development to increase the efficiency of development. The article concludes by recommending to remove financial barriers to entry and to provide technical trainings in local communities. ",
      "Key Findings": "The main findings are that the utility modifier mechanism—or development project finance—is the most prominent form of aid but is it not a sufficient mechanism to fully remove the barriers needed to catalyze private investment in geothermal deployment in a self-sustaining way. Project finance (utility modifier) is often intertwined with policy diffusion (social learning) and trainings (capacity building), which more effectively removes barriers to geothermal development. These\nfindings have important policy implications for climate finance and development aid more broadly: to be most effective, climate finance should include a comprehensive package addressing major regulatory, financial, and technical barriers by combining policy advising and technical capacity building with project-based financial aid.\n\nMy findings demonstrate that political willingness to prioritize renewable energy development is a necessary condition for development aid effectiveness, and energy shocks influence political will. These intervening variables play a significant role in the effectiveness of climate finance mechanisms. The paper finds that policy dialogues over years and even decades between international institutions, transnational actors, gov-ernment ministries and industry incrementally led to social learning to ameliorate important regulatory barriers like government funding of exploration drilling in Indonesia or foreign ownership in the Philippines.",
      "Key Recommendations": "While much progress has been made in terms of removing barriers to geothermal development in Indonesia and the Philippines, some barriers still remain. The financial barriers in the Philippines are unresolved and may benefit from the proposed risk sharing mechanism or a feed-in-tariff, but further fiscal support for exploration drilling is needed. In Indonesia, the financial barriers are likely resolved with the GREM, but remain untested—only time will tell if this mechanism reduces the financial risks to sufficiently attract private investments. Further technical trainings through vocational programs would benefit developing domestic technical expertise in the local geothermal industry.",

      "Key Findings": "USAID/Mexico’s LandScale activity applies the LandScale Assessment Framework to evaluate and communicate landscape sustainability in the Sierra de Tapalpa landscape, including the municipalities of Chiquilistlán, Atemajac de Brizuela, Tapalpa, and San Gabriel in the state of Jalisco. The activity aims to promote better management practices in production systems and catalyze multi-stakeholder action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve landscape sustainability. Since confirming Jalisco as the intervention site at the end of March 2021, USAID and its implementing partner, Rainforest Alliance, have identified and established partnerships with local stakeholders and several key agricultural private sector actors in the region. These partnerships include berry, avocado, potato, and other agricultural producers, along with the Jalisco Agriculture and Agro-Industrial Development Council (CDAAJ), which represents some of these producers. The activity values these partnerships as essential to reach LandScale’s long-term objectives and ensure the sustainability of its impact.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In addition, private-sector actors provided two key recommendations around partnerships that could further support the activity’s outcomes and sustainability. First, the activity could include representatives of Mexico’s federal government as part of the committee because of their role in drafting and enforcing federal environmental laws. Second, more direct engagement between the private sector and USAID could generate further confidence in and enthusiasm for the activity.",

To accomplish this, RCBP promotes climate-smart bio-commerce activities, improved governance, restoration projects, and ecosystem monitoring. The project engages a wide range of local community associations and microenterprises and connects them to distributors. Creating linkages between buyers and sellers is expected to increase sales opportunities and help identify supply chain gaps in services, equipment, financing, and best practices.",

      "Key Findings": "Through USAID/Peru’s Alianza Forestal, an activity implemented by AIDER (a Peruvian NGO), seven Indigenous communities are increasing their economic opportunities while conserving a critical natural resource. Alianza Forestal engages various private-sector actors to support the bioeconomy and ecology by helping communities sustainably manage their forests to provide carbon credits and forest and agroforestry products, such as cacao, timber, and handicrafts, and linking them to larger markets. The activity also trains and mentors communities to collect relevant forest information and monitor and report illegal logging and land invasions. The goal is to improve the use of resources through the development of sustainable economic enterprises, restore degraded lands, conserve forests and biodiversity, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The activity utilizes a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism to further these desired outcomes. Companies emitting carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gasses can offset their emissions by buying carbon credits generated by the Indigenous communities.This work has shown promise, with positive reviews from participating communities and the resource partner, indicating the sustainability of this activity and the potential to be scaled up beyond the activity’s support.",
      "Key Recommendations": "\"Differences in vocabulary and timeliness between USAID, implementing partners, and private-sector partners can pose challenges to effective engagement. Development organizations often use acronyms and reference concepts unfamiliar to the private sector. The private sector may expect measures, such as profitability and cost-savings, not often captured in activity performance indicators. Additionally, USAID’s procurement and approval processes can seem prolonged to private-sector actors accustomed to making decisions at a faster\npace. Working with a like-minded private-sector partner familiar with development language and building trust using the method of co-creation helped Alianza Forestal avoid some of these known challenges.\"",

      "Document Title": "Promoting Responsible Business Conduct: A scoping paper for donors supporting Private Sector Engagement",
      "Key Findings": "Three specific key takeaways for future government-wide actions on RBC include:\n1. The value of multi-stakeholder consultation processes (including donor agencies) in the design of any RBC-related legislation, as well as the need for inter-governmental coordination. While several EU countries already seem to prefer EU-level over national-level legislation, private sector feedback also suggests a strong preference for a level playing field, which could be created by either EU-level legislation or harmonised national-level legislation. \n\n2. The growing need for strategic whole-of-government approaches to RBC, including through overarching policy frameworks and formal coordination mechanisms between relevant government entities (including donor agencies). In many countries, this is also likely to require further capacitybuilding on RBC at all relevant policy levels (e.g., procurement policy).\n\n3. The value of further expanding and enhancing the accessibility of information and capacity-building services, either directly by the government or by third parties, to help businesses navigate the growing range of national legislative requirements, policies and support offers.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Potential action areas in the context of legislation and regulation on RBC: A key action area for donor agency PSE units is to review implications of any new or forthcoming relevant legislation for their\nprogrammes, potentially with support from legal advisers. This has happened in Germany, for example, where BMZ has reviewed implications of Germany’s 2021 Act on Corporate Due Diligence\nObligations in Supply Chains for its partnership programmes. \n\n2. Potential action areas in the context of facilitation and motivation of RBC: Donor agencies are particularly active in three sets of efforts to facilitate and motivate RBC, thereby tackling different business drivers of RBC and levers of change in the ecosystem in which companies operate. Specific potential areas of future support are summarised below: \n  a. Enabling access to voluntary standards and codes of conduct:\n  b. Promoting peer pressure, dialogue and other collective action among companies: \n  c. Increasing awareness on RBC among consumers and investors:\n  d. Coordination within donor agencies (for all efforts to facilitate and motivate PSE):\n\n3. Potential action areas in the context of partnerships and engagement on RBC: Partnerships and engagement with individual companies or private sector groups are typically a core responsibility of donor agency PSE units. While most donors consider RBC in their partner screening and selection (for all kinds of partnerships), the specific approaches for doing so are very diverse and still evolving. Peer exchange among donor agencies (and potentially with DFIs) could therefore be useful to compare and learn from experiences. While still concentrated among relatively few donor agencies, interest in partnerships with the primary objective to promote RBC has been growing in recent years. An initial exchange of experiences and lessons learnt from recent dedicated funds and calls for proposals focused on RBC could therefore help inform future practice. In some donor countries, this may include partnerships to help companies achieve compliance with new RBC legislation. Similarly, it could be of interest to compare donors’ current experiences in how to effectively convene, cofacilitate and contribute to discussions on RBC in national or sector-level private sector groups.\n\n4. Potential action areas in the context of publicity and endorsement: Few clear implications have emerged with regard to publicity for, and endorsement of, RBC performance of individual companies. Probably the most widespread practice among donors is the use of light-touch publicity for positive examples. This could potentially be expanded, e.g., through more systematic thematic or sectoral case studies that illustrate companies’ journey towards better RBC performance. Official government-sponsored awards and labels require appropriate design in order to have a potential positive impact, but they also carry a higher risk for governments.\n\n5. Other implications cutting across RBC instruments: Two cross-cutting key issues for further consideration by donor agencies came up repeatedly in DCED member interviews: \n - Building capacity in donor agencies (and implementing organisations) to incorporate RBC aspects into PSE:\n- Refining approaches for dealing with large companies:",

      "Key Findings": "Though the project made marked progress in its first year setting up project operations and securing stakeholder buy-in, activity implementation was not without its challenges. A few lessons to note from Year 1 include:\n- During the second surge of COVID-19 between June and July 2021, MPHD program implementation was severely affected due to the resulting government-mandated lockdowns. As a result, the project offered support to implement some of its activities to support the GOI during the pandemic. Project staff collaborated at the national-level with the MOH and at the sub-national level with the PHOs, provincial governments, and professional organizations to conduct a series of COVID-19 mitigation webinars, talk shows, and campaigns. We worked to provide education and campaign media to raise awareness of recent MOH guidelines for health care providers and communities regarding protocols on COVID-19 mitigation for pregnant women and newborns, rights and obligations of patients and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The webinars also addressed issues of quality and patient safety in MNH services.\n- MPHD faces the unique position of navigating the interests of two different arms of the Indonesian MOH. The focus of the project (MNH) falls within the remit of the Family Health Directorate, while the main (sponsoring) counterpart of MPHD is the Quality and Accreditation Directorate. These directorates are further distinct within the MOH in that they sit under two separate “Directorate Generals.” The diversity of these stakeholders, even within the same MOH, posed challenges for MPHD relating to the alignment of priorities across MOH stakeholders. However, it also served as an important opportunity for the MOH to further consider how public and private facilities and both the primary and referral levels may operate in service of improved MNH outcomes for the Indonesian population.\n- The baseline assessment activity, initially scheduled for earlier in the workplan year, was not implemented until after August 2021. The second wave of the pandemic delayed the MAY Directorate’s ability to send out introductory letters to the five PHOs where the assessment would take place. \n- During Year 1 and throughout the pandemic, the provinces covered by the MPHD project experienced varying degrees of travel restrictions. This complicated efforts to unilaterally roll out project activities and schedule meetings with stakeholders. As travel restrictions were slowly lifted across Indonesia, the project team was able to resume activities and important meetings. ",

It does this by comparing and analyzing  NDBs in China, India, and Germany. The document found that NDBs work as policy coordinators that scale up finance for climate related programmes. “NDBs play this policy coordination role through three mechanisms: 1) providing expertise and channeling market information/feedbacks to the policymaking process to advance renewable energy designs and refinement; 2) mitigating policy gaps or barriers that cannot be, or can only partially be, alleviated by existing renewable energy policies; and 3) providing a coherent and holistic basket of financial services to concentrate resources behind national priorities”.  The study also examines the differences in developing and developed countries in regard to their support of renewable energy finance to show how developed countries have made climate policies that facilitate investment.  \n",
      "Key Findings": ". Governments should focus on a stable and well-designed policy framework to scale up climate finance.\n. NDBs can then serve in a policy coordinator role to amplify the impacts of climate policies.\n. NDBs can provide expertise and channel market information/feedbacks to advance design of climate finance policies.\n.

      "Document Title": "Donor Agency Engagement in Gender Lens Investing: Approaches and Opportunities",
      "Key Findings": "The field of gender lens investing is dynamic and evolving. In recent years, the field has broadened to include investments at the sectoral and market levels, in addition to the enterprise level, and to take a comprehensive and intersectional approach to gender analysis and impact. An approach to gender lens investing that incorporates attention to power and bias across the investment process dovetails neatly with the goals identified in women’s economic empowerment frameworks. Within this context, we call attention to the role that donor agencies can play in mobilizing private capital to advance gender equality goals. We highlight specific opportunities for innovative investment and mobilization of donor agencies that are already involved in women’s economic empowerment programming to engage with the gender lens investing field, including an increased incorporation of a gender lens in investments related to COVID recovery and response efforts and climate resilience, as well as in all risk analyses. Notably, applying a gender lens in these opportunities strengthens the investment overall and provides a compound avenue for impact that incorporates broad health, social, and environmental outcomes together with increased gender equality goals.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This paper is directed toward those donor agencies that wish to make a positive impact on gender equality goals through levers of finance. Thus, we review strategies that donor agencies can leverage to address women’s economic empowerment goals through finance including increased integration of gender expertise across the investment process, catalysing investment through innovative approaches, and ensuring the participation of diverse expertise across the investment process. This paper seeks to demonstrate the role that donor agencies may play as field builders to improve gender equality goals.",

      "Document Summary": "This document studies how USAID can assist Latin America and the Caribbean regarding disaster relief and resilience to climate change, by creating a Caribbean-wide vision. It uses the input from 33 informants to examine the USAID Missions in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Caribbean is at high risk for climate change because of its large quantities of  coastal areas, which puts residents at risk. The report found that regional support needs assistance from external sources. USAID has provided program support for these sectors: biodiversity and natural resources, communities and vulnerable populations, infrastructure, and key economic sectors and livelihoods, including agriculture and tourism. Through its analysis the report concluded that USAID succeeded in making strategic and collaborative investments that will promote sustainable practices in a unified Caribbean climate action plan. It also recommends in the future that the plan increases collaboration, scale, alignment, and response. ",
      "Key Findings": "1. The level of resilience to climate change varies among countries in the region, with countries at different stages of absorptive, adaptive, and transformative resilience capacity. Donor investment strategies need to reflect this range of capacity and needs while promoting a comprehensive regional approach.\n2. DRM and climate adaptation policies are being developed and refined in many countries, but implementation of these policies is weak due to\nlack of awareness, regulatory frameworks and enforcement, technical capacity, and funding.\n3. Caribbean institutions require long-term, stable funding to support core operations, build institutional capacity, and conduct research\nand technology transfer. \n4. Development of data and information about severe events, near-term and seasonal forecasts, climate change, and adaptation strategies is\nadvancing at the regional level. \n5. Technology innovation is progressing in some sectors, such as agriculture and energy, but implementation is limited due to inadequate\nawareness, low capacity, low market demand, and limited national and regional private-sector suppliers. Penetration of technology innovations in\nkey sectors—including USAID priority sectors of biodiversity, agriculture, and energy—is limited.\n6. Lack of livelihood security in key nature-based economic sectors jeopardizes the ability of communities to respond to climate-related\nhazards, counteract crime and gender-based violence, and build local resilience. \n7. Lack of financial instruments to manage disaster risk contribute to an ongoing cycle of disaster recovery and response, limiting the ability of\ncountries to invest in adaptation strategies and long-term resilience.\n8. There is a significant lack of private-sector investment and financing of adaptation, DRM, and resilience strategies, limiting the region’s ability to\naddress climate risk at scale and speed.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The following key recommended strategies would provide cross-cutting support to build country capacities in the Caribbean region across all four\nbuilding blocks of resilience: institutional, knowledge and technology innovation, human and communities, and financial.\n• Collaborate: Develop a joint Regional Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan and associated Pooled Climate Change Resilience Fund in\ncollaboration with regional institutions, international donors, and national and local stakeholders.\n• Scale: Build on successful USAID programs to scale strong strategies region-wide, such as Caribbean Energy Initiative, Water Security Initiative, and Disaster Risk Financing Initiative.\n• Align: Ensure all USAID sectoral programming fully integrates climate risk and aligns with national NDCs and adaptation plans, including in biodiversity, agriculture, WASH, and energy.\n• Respond: Maintain a diverse, country-driven portfolio while promoting a regional strategy for resilience.",

      "Key Findings": "Salient trends that can be distilled from major activities in process include: \n\n1. Capital mobilization results are ramping up as expected following\nan intensive period of design and procurement, reaching USD42.2 million cumulative capital mobilized. Most of the capital mobilized by CATALYZE is in Europe and Africa, followed by Latin America.\n\n2. The most common blended finance, pay-for-result incentive used\nacross all CATALYZE Activities is Business Advisory Services (BAS), although half of all Activities will be applying FI incentives.\n\n3. Debt is the predominant form of capital mobilized for businesses\nsupported by CATALYZE, with factoring as an important, emerging product among two Activities.\n\n4. Cumulative private capital mobilized is principally in the agriculture sector (37% of all capital mobilized by CATALYZE), followed by manufacturing (35%), commerce (16%) and tourism (5%).\n\n5. Forty-one percent of all firms supported by CATALYZE are women-owned, however women-owned businesses constitute (13%) of all SMEs receiving cumulative financing support under CATALYZE. We expect this percentage to increase with the rollout of gender action plans for each Activity.\n\n6. CATALYZE is supporting a range of business sizes with financing\nand other supports, from microentrepreneurs to schools to large\nenterprises, with micro and small enterprises representing the largest group receiving support (73%), but small- and medium-sized enterprises accessing the highest volume of capital. This quarter, 873 entities received support from CATALYZE, including\n662 firms, 210 schools and one association.\n\n7. After participating in co-creation of performance work statements for CATALYZE Activities, USAID mission personnel are updated on a weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis with progress reports from each of the CATALYZE activities, thereby improving institutional capability and understanding of how private sector engagement and capital mobilization programming are managed.",

      "Document Summary": "This case study examines The Indonesian Climate Trust Fund to analyze its effectiveness for its new climate action mechanisms. Implementing efficient financing institutions, with regards to climate change, is difficult in developing countries because they lack necessary infrastructure. The study evaluates climate finance prototypes while keeping in mind, “und mobilization, nature of projects, equity and inclusion, alignment and mainstreaming.“ It specifically examined current  literature regarding climate change financing and interviews with key stakeholders. It found that the most effective climate finance projects are aligned with national development plans and Sustainable Development Goals. Additionally,  principles of equity and inclusion of stakeholders are important to maintain trust. The fund has had difficulty moving funds, due to technology constraints, and needs support from donors and the Indonesian government. \n",
      "Key Findings": "Our study found the ICCTF most effective in alignment with national development plans and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It has implemented climate change adaptation programmes with the principles of equity and inclusion of various stakeholders. The ICCTF has however struggled to efficiently mobilize funds owing largely to technical ambiguities especially in its legal and institutional frameworks, it therefore yet to be utilized to its maximum potentials.",

      "Document Summary": "This document examines how to foster private sector development in Honduras by creating inclusive and profitable markets. Honduras has a lot of potential for economic development because it has a young population, a variety of microclimates, a market-oriented reform agenda, and a convenient geographic location that allows easy access to foreign markets. The COVID-19 pandemic did impact the country’s economic growth, along with tropical cyclones that affected the country. This document examines and gives recommendations for how to expand private sector engagement in the agricultural sector, the manufacturing sector, business processing, and digital finance services. It found that the lack of resources was the main barrier for private sector development. The document gave many time oriented recommendations that addressed the lack of resources and the obstacles to productivity and competitiveness. ",
      "Key Findings": "1) Due to Honduras’s agro-ecological conditions, strategic location, and liberal trade policies, the agribusiness sector offers attractive opportunities for investment, employment creation, and broad-based growth.\n2) In the agricultural sector, lack of access to high-quality inputs, financing, infrastructure, logistics services, knowledge systems, and food quality and safety verification, as well as exposure to climate change impacts are key constraints on growth and diversification.\n3) Honduras’s light manufacturing sector, which is largely built on the maquila model shows a strong revealed competitive advantage in several products. \n4) Inadequate public services, a lack of appropriate workforce skills, and the limited local sourcing of raw materials present key challenges in the maquila subsector.\n5) One of the fastest-growing sectors in Honduras is BPO, which offers opportunities to create high-quality jobs while increasing domestic value addition.\n6) The growth of the BPO industry is inhibited by insufficient access to\ntelecommunications infrastructure, the inadequate capacity of national\ntelecommunications networks, low levels of broadband penetration, complex registration processes, and skills mismatches.\n7) Expanding access to DFS among MSMEs could catalyze growth and diversification. The Honduran financial sector is stable, liquid, and well capitalized.\n8) Insufficient capital, limited access to financial infrastructure, and regulatory gaps slow the development of digital financial services among institutions best placed to serve MSMEs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1) To achieve the targets of the Honduras 20/20 strategy, the authorities must address the challenges described above and create the necessary conditions to increase product complexity. \n2) Shifting consumer trends create an opportunity for Honduran producers to move from cotton to synthetic knits.\n3) The limited supply of woven fabrics in the region highlights the opportunity for new investments in textiles mills.\n4) The development of eco-friendly solutions can be a source of competitive advantage.\n5) Honduras has opportunities to diversify to other markets beyond the United States.\n6) Greater regional coordination will enhance regional trade and strengthen Central America as an economic bloc.\n7) As the US nearshoring process accelerates, and global supply chains shorten, Honduras is well placed to capture new buyers and strategic investors.",

      "Document Summary": "This working paper examines the role digital technologies play in regards to food security, starvation, and famine risk. It does this by looking at the role of digital technologies in international law. The document discusses perpetrators of violence use social media to manipulate populations and how they can shut down technology, which can cause serious food security issues. Digital technologies are also used by the private sector to assess food security, famine risk, and starvation crimes. The study found that private sector participation is rarely concerned with humanitarian concerns and digital technologies can address this issue by analyzing the private sector’s participation. Digital technologies are not concerned with international human law, which is why this paper is valuable in starting the conversation surrounding how digital technologies can be used in humanitarian law in regards to food security. ",
      "Key Findings": "Cyberoperations are increasingly used in war to disrupt or shutdown networks, and we explore whether and how the prohibition of starv- ing civilians under IHL applies. In conflict situations, warring parties can manipulate social media and shutdown mobile phone and internet connections, which has serious implications for the severity of conflict, food systems and livelihoods. As digital technologies proliferate, humanitarian and human rights organisations use them to assess food security, famine risk and starvation crimes. Famine researchers and legal experts have used digital forensics as part of investigations into famine crimes. A key risk in digitalised assistance is politically motivated exclusions or persecution based on centralised digital beneficiary identification systems. Extensive private sector involvement also raises an issue about the impartiality, neutrality and independence of humanitarian relief (a requirement under IHL).",
      "Key Recommendations": "Issues of data protection and surveillance are new areas of exploration for IHL. If authoritarian or oppressive governments have access to centralised digital identities, they can use this to exclude or persecute particular population groups or political opposition. Some legal analysts argue that data, thus including beneficiary data, can be considered a civilian object under IHL and their manipulation considered an attack if it leads to injury or death. Government agencies, technology companies and aid organisations have all been subjected to cyberattacks, indicating the need for greater caution. It also highlights the need for back-up non-digital options in aid delivery. Finally, the neo-colonial nature of digital\ntechnologies needs serious attention in the field of famine prevention. If data is decided on, extracted, and used by outsiders from the Global North, it will undermine local anti-famine political action. Local political action is as important as international action in preventing famine.",

      "Document Summary": "This document examines the impact of climate finance on gender equality for sustainable global development. Climate finance practices do not guarantee gender fairness policies and this document reviews how gender equity framework can optimize climate finance resources. It can actually have negative effects on women; for example: women in wetlands areas needs are not met when climate finance resources are given out, which causes structural division. Women are also banned from working in coastal protection management because of the enforced patriarchy. This article looks at the current status of women and gives recommendations for the future like recommending, “policymakers to  integrate gender-responsive components into climate finance frameworks to ratify structural and behavioral  inequalities along with empowering women to engage in climate action ventures without undermining their  adequate living conditions.” It concludes by recommending that women are not included, but engaged in climate finance direction and strategy. ",
      "Key Findings": "The current paper presents a broad review of literature, expanding on the ‘distributive, contextual, and procedural’ equity framework on climate mitigation and adaptation strategies including, coastal wetland protection and sustainable agroforestry. The review reveals that the implications of climate finance are not parallelly distributed between men and women and climate action, in several contexts and spaces, exacerbates already existing structural and climate change-induced inequalities even\nfurther. To optimize the effectiveness of climate finance, the paper urges authorities and policymakers to integrate gender-responsive components into climate finance frameworks to ratify structural and behavioral\ninequalities along with empowering women to engage in climate action ventures without undermining their adequate living conditions.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This review points out that an empowering strategy and enabling policy are important in ensuring equitable benefits of climate finance to both women and men. In order to proffer healthy and enabling conditions foreveryone, climate financing programs need to include gender-responsive policies that not only disentangle the deeply embedded hegemonic socio-cultural structures but also foster behavioral change against gender stereotypes on an individual level.\nFurthermore, just focusing on women won't be adequate, women must be effectively engaged with a climate action venture’s direction and strategies to manifest prolific outcomes as when resources and backing from climate finance schemes line up with women’s necessities, women more frequently start taking up prominent decision making roles inside the climate action ventures. \nAlong with unraveling societal structures and behavioral patterns, this paper further accentuates the significance of human and social capital modules of climate finance strategies particularly when they center around information imparting and capacity building. With enhanced human and social capital through climate financing plans, women and gender minorities can get sufficient resources and information that was previously accessible to men. They can gain new abilities that can not only enable them to turn  into useful managers of ecological assets and adjust to environmental disturbances such as environmental and climate change but can also make them active partakers and implementors of climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.",

      "Document Summary": "This report provides disaggregated data analysis of climate finance provided and mobilised in 2016-2020 across climate finance components, themes, sectors, and financial instruments. It also explores key trends and provides insight relating to the distribution and concentration of climate finance provided and mobilised across different developing country characteristics and groupings. The concluding chapter of the report provides further insights on the impacts and effectiveness of climate finance, as well as meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation. The findings complement the OECD report Aggregate Trends of Climate Finance Provided and Mobilised by Developed Countries in 2013-2020.",
      "Key Findings": "The main conclusion is that over 2016-2020 public climate finance providers mostly mobilised private climate finance for projects in countries with medium or relatively low-risk profiles:\n- Based on the Allianz Medium-Term Country Risk Ratings, mobilised private climate finance predominantly benefited countries with a lower risk rating (B/BB), accounting for 45% of the total.\n- Using the Coface Business Climate Assessment, approximately 52% of private climate finance was mobilised for projects in countries with the lowest risk rating (A).\n- Private climate finance mobilised for countries with the riskiest ratings, i.e. D for the Allianz rating or C, D and E for the Coface rating, accounted for 27% and 19% respectively.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Ultimately, effective climate mitigation and adaptation action takes place in and is shaped by the socioeconomic situation of each country. The scale and type of climate finance provided and mobilised differ depending on each developing country's characteristics. Enhancing the enabling environment for climate action and investment has two key dimensions: efforts to enhance the policy and regulatory environment, alongside building core capacities at the country level.",

      "Document Summary": "While sustainable finance approaches are increasingly used by financial market participants, a number of challenges still undermine and hinder the efficient mobilisation of capital to support environmental, social and governance (ESG), and climate-related objectives. These challenges include limited transparency and comparability of climate transition and ESG methodologies and metrics. This document provides guidance for policy makers and market participants seeking to strengthen ESG investing and finance a climate transition through the use of quality metrics, ratings, targets and frameworks.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Policy makers, financial authorities and central banks (where appropriate within domestic mandates) should strengthen the availability and use of reliable, comparable and high-quality data to assess climate risks and opportunities in line with global baseline standards.\n\nWhere within their mandates, policymakers, financial authorities and central banks should support the consistent and transparent use of climate-related metrics by third-parties, in order to foster greater quality and comparability across jurisdictions and industries.\n\nWhere within their mandates, the relevant authorities should support the development of transition plans by financial intermediaries that include overall net-zero and interim targets that are supported by up-to-date and sound scientific methodologies consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nPolicymakers and market participants should collaborate within international fora to share good practices and continually strengthen the appropriate use of net-zero strategies and associated tools for financial firms who have made voluntary net-zero commitments, including by issuing guidance.\n\nFinancial authorities should use the mechanisms available to them to support high-quality data and the monitoring of such data, including interim targets, in transition plans, including through third-party verification of information.\n\nWhere consistent with domestic mandates, policymakers should use the tools available to guide good practices of market participants that wish to improve climate aligned investing and engagement strategies. This should include, but not be limited to, greater transparency of expectations, incentives and options for accountability where implementation falls short of firms’ transition plans and targets over time, when within investor objectives.\n\n",

      "Document Title": "How to Cut Methane Emissions",
      "Document Summary": "Limiting global warming to 1.5 to 2°C above preindustrial levels requires rapid cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. This includes methane, which has an outsized impact on temperatures. To date, 125 countries have pledged to cut global methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030. This Note provides background on methane emission sources, presents practical fiscal policy options to cut emissions, and assesses impacts. Putting a price on methane, ideally through a fee, would reduce emissions efficiently, and can be administratively straightforward for extractives industries and, in some cases, agriculture. Policies could also include revenue-neutral ‘feebates’ that use fees on dirtier polluters to subsidize cleaner producers. A $70 methane fee among large economies would align 2030 emissions with 2°C. Most cuts would be in extractives and abatement costs would be equivalent to just 0.1 percent of GDP. Costs are larger in certain developing countries, implying climate finance could be a key element of a global agreement on a minimum methane price.",
      "Key Findings": "Cutting methane emissions is critical to stabilizing the global climate.\n\nThis Note has emphasized the potential role of methane fees—or variants of fees. These can be integrated into existing fiscal regimes in the extractives sector, where the bulk of the low-cost mitigation opportunities in the near term are located.\n\nGlobal and national strategies for cutting methane emissions need to be fleshed out, but the GMP provides a potential platform for discussion.\n\nPrivate sector initiatives on cutting methane emissions have been building since the Paris Agreement but are still lagging. Several measures to boost transparency on methane emissions have also been adopted by the private sector. However, these disclosures are still falling short in data reliability and consistency and effective integration into financial decision-making.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Scaling up cross-border private climate financing while reinforcing the climate information architecture for methane could strengthen scrutiny over methane emissions globally.",

      "Document Title": "Energy Transition: Mixed Momentum on the Path to Net Zero Vol. 1",
      "Document Summary": "This document examines how the energy sector is trying to move towards net-zero carbon, by 2050. COP26 set goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help developing countries with climate action policies. The U.S., China, and EU are the three major economies aiming to transition toward more sustainable energy sources. This volume of Energy Transition looks specifically at, \"(1) where we are on the commitments agreed to last year at COP26 given recent geopolitical and climate events, and (2) what needs to be done to keep momentum on track in the Energy Transition.\" \n\nThe key findings of the document include: the private sector made large amounts of progress to meet the net-zero commitments; greenflation affects the private sector like it affects the public sector due to higher energy and raw material costs; the financial community does not expect to see a resurgence of financing for coal or other carbon-intensive industries; and sustainable finance is slowing. ",
      "Key Findings": "The private sector also made enormous progress, not least in terms of the vast number of net-zero commitments made in the run up to, and at, COP26. There are now thousands of companies globally committed to net zero by 2050, including many of the world’s largest companies, even in sectors such as Oil & Gas. Perhaps of greatest significance was the progress made in the financial community. Most notable was the progress made with GFANZ (Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero), essentially a global coalition of leading financial institutions committed to accelerating the decarbonization of the economy.\n\nThe impacts on the private sector will be no less profound than those for the public sector. Corporates are experiencing higher energy and raw material costs, alongside greenflation, the impacts of broader inflation (and its implications for wage inflation via increased costs of living), and a rising rate cycle. As with the public sector, while the short-term focus is likely to be on energy security and economic viability, the exposure to these dislocations, plus commodity availability and price volatility, is likely to drive a desire for greater resilience and energy security, which is again likely to entail zero-carbon energy sources.\n\nFor the financial community, while what we conventionally think of as stranded fossil assets may have received a short reprieve, the longer-term direction of travel remains clear, and hence we do not expect to see a resurgence of financing for coal or other carbon-intensive industries. However, as mentioned earlier, the financial dislocations of recent months have led to a reduction in the issuance of sustainable finance.",

      "Document Summary": "Commitments made under the Paris Agreement in 2015 were an important first step in addressing climate issues. Still, now is the time to turn promises into global action and recommit to tackling the climate crisis. Given the scale of the issue, Citi GPS has published Energy Transition in two volumes. Volume II — Building Bridges to Renew Momentum — focuses on the funding requirements and tools required to ensure a successful Energy Transition. This Volume covers the following topics: the role and future of direct air capture, nuclear innovation, what it takes to finance a green hydrogen industry, voluntary carbon markets and the importance of pricing carbon, responsible early retirement of coal, and decarbonizing portfolios for the energy transition.",
      "Key Findings": "Since their first introduction as a potential tool for fighting and reversing climate change, DAC technologies have certainly come far. Through a combination of technology breakthroughs, falling renewable power prices, supportive government policies, and growing investor funding, DAC is now more viable than ever before. There is significant private sector momentum building behind DAC with a multitude of announcements in 2022, coupled with the rise of various sources of private sector funding for DAC technologies.\n\nThe arsenal of investment instruments for hydrogen financing is significantly limited compared to other, more traditional energy sources and carriers, and is mainly represented by straight and structured equity raisings for smaller independent players (both private and public) and corporate debt/hybrid solutions.\n\nIn the absence of strong government policies and schemes to price carbon, the private sector is increasingly turning to what is referred to as the voluntary carbon market. While the voluntary carbon market is still inchoate, it has the potential to both accelerate the Energy Transition and to become an important asset class on its own.\n\nThe key to a realistic Energy Transition is the involvement of private sector investment at significant scale with multiple parties needed to participate to achieve the right catalysis.\n\nBlended finance is therefore the key to making private sector investment viable. This would involve the provision of significant concessionary financing from governments, MDBs and multilateral organizations, NGOs, and foundations.",

      "Document Summary": "This document examines food security across the globe. Droughts, armed conflict, inflation, and supply chain issues have led to an increase in food insecurity. The document then looks at four categories social, technological, economic/financial, and governmental to see how each sector can help solve food insecurity. It also examines how financial services can help investment in infrastructure that will lead to an increase in food production and transportation. The document found that all sectors can make changes to help solve food insecurity: the public sector can contribute debt relief, diplomacy, aid, policy, and self-sufficiency; the financial sector can contribute blended finance and supply chain management; the private sector can contribute agtech; and civil society can help by reducing food waste and making dietary changes. ",
      "Key Findings": "The proposed solutions can be bucketed into four categories: social, technological, economic/financial, and governmental. Society can make small changes to eliminate food waste or shifting to a more plant-based diet, which would increase the amount of available food. Technological innovation in alternative proteins and indoor farming as well as automation and robotics can help in ensure food self-sufficiency for regions reliant on imports and improve the food ecosystem.\n\nFinancing vehicles such as blended finance and hedging facilities can help facilitate investment in infrastructure. And government is needed to help push the agenda forward with targeted policy and regulation as well as provide humanitarian aid and sustained investment in global agriculture.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Public Sector: Focus on diplomacy, food self-sufficiency, and onshoring; enable and provide access to financing, potentially via blended finance, aid, or debt relief; and concentrate investment in infrastructure and food systems. Additionally, consider taxation and other incentives to promote healthier diets, focusing on incentives that utilize available agricultural resources most efficiently, and seek to eliminate food waste at all stages of the chain.\nPrivate Sector: Focus on food waste reduction and supply chain management and work with consumers to facilitate dietary shifts to a food system that effectively manages resources. Accelerate investment into AgTech, including vertical, indoor and digital farming; alternative proteins and precision fermentation; animal AgTech; and automation and robotics.\nFinancial Sector: Facilitate investment in infrastructure for the public and private sector to enhance onshore production; eliminate food waste; build more efficient agricultural and food systems; provide financing vehicles such as blended finance and hedging facilities; and promote fintech across the agricultural chain.\nCivil Society: Focus on reducing and eliminating food waste and on dietary shifts, which can lead to more optimal usage of resources. Smaller and individual farmers should seek access to fintech solutions to improve financial inclusion, stabilize income, and maximize revenues.",

      "Document Title": "Climate Finance: Mobilizing the Public and Private Sector to Ensure a Just Energy Transition",
      "Document Summary": "This document \"Mobilizing the Public and Private Sector to Ensure a Just Energy Transition,\" examines how the private sector can pay for the new green agenda set by COP26. Two questions guide this report, \"(1) What investment is needed in different regions and countries for climate mitigation and adaptation? and (2) How can we mobilize this investment efficiently to enable the world to reach its climate goals while still growing in population and developing the economy?\" \n\nThe document found that there needs to be clear information given to companies, so they can make effective investments; the complexity of climate finance architecture needs to be lessened; and the disconnect between public and private actors needs to be addressed. Additionally, blended finance and development finance institutions can work to increase private sector investment in developing countries. ",
      "Key Findings": "Mobilizing climate financing is a challenge as there is no one global solution. The public sector, including governments and development finance institutions, has played an extremely important role in mobilizing finance and the private sector has contributed 49% of investment funds. Unlocking private sector capital for climate finance is crucial as private actors could provide 70% of the $2.6 trillion needed in investment every year (on average in 2021-25) to put the world on a path to net zero by 2050.\n\nFinancial instruments, such as blended finance, in conjunction with development finance institutions can increase private sector investment in developing economies. And green banks, which develop clean project pipelines, are using innovative financing to accelerate the transition to clean energy.\n\nCollaboration — between developed and developing economies as well as the public and private sectors — is key to making this a just transition",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. We need to develop consistent, clear, and commonly accepted definitions, taxonomies, and methodologies to be able to assess current flows, and accurately evaluate and effectively direct investments to where they are needed.\n2. We need to reduce the complexity and fragmentation of the global climate finance architecture that may create barriers to access for developing countries, some of whom lament the difficulties in accessing multilateral climate funds, including the processing time, data requests, and bottlenecks in the process. This complexity also makes tracking and monitoring of finance flows challenging.\n3. The opportunity for private finance to help plug the climate finance gap is immense, but there appears to be a disconnect between public and private actors. A better understanding of respective mandates, objectives, financial and non-financial barriers, risk appetites, and time horizons is needed to facilitate better collaboration and mobilization of capital.",

      "Document Title": "ADB Sustainable Development Working Paper Series, No. 84 - Accelerating Private Sector Engagement in Adaptation in Asia and the Pacific",
      "Document Summary": "The \"ADB Sustainable Development Working Paper Series, No. 84 - Accelerating Private Sector Engagement in Adaptation in Asia and the Pacific\" examines private sector engagement for development in Asia in regards to climate adaptation. Adaptation has mainly occured in the public sector, thus far in Asia and this document reviews how the private sector can get more involved. It discusses how the private sector needs to be adaptors, solution financers, and financers to promote climate adaptation. Finance institutions should use their full capabilities to create change: \"strengthen upstream engagement through policy dialogues and country programming processes, accelerate the development and piloting of new financing products and tools, deploy technical assistance strategically, leverage partnerships, and further enhance internal policy and operational processes so that these become conducive to engaging private sector entities in adaptation.\" ",
      "Key Findings": "To survive and thrive in a changing climate, businesses in the private sector need to become “adaptors.” In addressing the wide range of physical climate risks to communities, economies, and the environment, the private sector is relied upon to be the “solution providers”—to supply the technologies, the services, and the products for building climate resilience. As “financiers,” the private sector can help fill in the considerable gap in financing programs for adaptation. To date, all three forms of private sector engagement are taking place, to varying extents and degrees of participation.\n\nEven with the widely recognized need, private sector engagement in adaptation remains nascent and must overcome a number of profound challenges. These challenges include the following: (i) many private sector entities often have limited understanding of climate exposure and risks and their own businesses’ vulnerability and those of the wider society, thus, their inability to pinpoint where the needs are, and employ adaptation measures currently available; (ii) in many developing countries, enabling policy and other institutional conditions are not yet in place to facilitate private sector engagement in adaptation; and finally, (iii) the challenges in creating a viable value stream and financial incentives make it difficult for many private sector entities to build a compelling business case for taking adaptation action or investing in adaptation products and services.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Developing countries in Asia and the Pacific are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Development finance institutions (DFIs) working in the region are well placed to help accelerate private sector investments for adaptation. Some of the examples are technical assistance, policy and institutional development, risk analytics, and adaptation investment planning. DFIs can also help by improving the risk-adjusted return on investment profile through their deployment of risk-tolerant financing instruments and tools. As small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of developing economies, DFIs in these countries could immensely support and stimulate SMEs to engage in adaptation as these enterprises have the knowledge of the local markets and can operate in local currencies. Since they often lack the capacity and resources, SMEs could benefit and robustly thrive with the support of multilateral and bilateral DFIs.\n\nBuilding on its financing support for adaptation at project level, primarily through sovereign operations, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other DFIs could scale up their support to developing countries in Asia and the Pacific in building climate resilience—by accelerating the engagement of the private sector. DFIs could mobilize all function teams and work through their full operational cycle to (i) strengthen upstream engagement through policy dialogues and country programming processes, (ii) accelerate the development and piloting of new financing products and tools, (iii) deploy technical assistance strategically, (iv) leverage partnerships, and (v) further enhance internal policy and operational processes so that these become conducive to engaging private sector entities in adaptation.\n",

      "Document Title": "Finance for climate action: scaling up investment for climate and development",
      "Document Summary": "\"Finance for climate action: scaling up investment for climate and development\" realizes that climate change is occurring faster than anticipated. Smart climate financing needs to occur to promote positive climate transformation. The document acknowledges that necessary investments and their finance requires accelerating investment, mobilising private finance at scale, revamping the role of MDBs, delivering on and expanding the scope of concessional finance, and tackling indebtedness. Developed countries are also aiming to mobilize 100 billion dollars a year to climate finance by 2020. Taking these actions will help prevent a future energy crisis. ",
      "Key Findings": "Acting on climate is about transforming our economies, particularly our energy systems, through investing in net zero, adaptation, resilience and natural capital. Achieving this transformation will not be easy. It requires strong investment and innovation, and the right scale of finance of the right kind and at the right time.\n\nThe failure to deliver the climate finance commitment of $100 billion per year by 2020 made by developed countries at successive COPs has eroded trust. The world needs a breakthrough and a new roadmap on climate finance that can mobilise the $1 trillion per year in external finance that will be needed by 2030 for emerging markets and developing countries (EMDCs) other than China.\n\nA major, rapid and sustained investment push is needed to drive a strong and sustainable recovery out of current and recent crises, transform economic growth, and to deliver on shared development and climate goals.\n\nThe key investment priorities must encompass transformation of the energy system, respond to the growing vulnerability of developing countries to climate change, and restore the damage to natural capital and biodiversity.\n\nCountry/sector platforms driven by countries can bring together key stakeholders around a purposeful strategy, scaling up investments, tackling obstacles or binding constraints, ensuring a just transition and mobilising finance, especially private finance.\n\nThe scale of the investments needed in EMDCs over the next five years and beyond will require a debt and financing strategy that tackles festering debt difficulties, especially those of poor and vulnerable countries, and that leads to a major expansion of both domestic and international finance, public and private, concessional and non-concessional. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Countries should set strong targets for emissions reductions, aligned to the Paris Agreement and UNFCCC, and adopt credible, efficient and equitable policies for achieving them. This clear sense of purpose will enable the investments, particularly from the private sector but also, and importantly, the public sector, necessary to achieve the targets and to generate the new story of growth and development for the 21st century.\n\nCountries should work together and learn from one another: by sharing experiences of policies and associated institutions, for example (such as on carbon markets and pricing). Such collaboration can also foster coherence on standards and procurement to help generate larger and vibrant markets that can embody economies of scale in discovery and production and drive down costs. And such coherence of targets and actions can help generate confidence, crucial for investment, in markets across the world. Collaboration through the World Trade Organization will also be of real importance.\n\nThe private sector, its investment, innovation and finance, will be at the core of the necessary action. The private sector should not simply wait for countries and international organisations to create the ‘necessary conditions for investment’. Those conditions are crucial – and the private sector should be very active in helping create them. Governments should work with the private sector, through country, sector, regional and international platforms for investment and innovation, including through international collaborations and institutions.\n\nThe MDBs have a central role to play, given the importance of the conditions for investment and innovation, the scale of the necessary investment, the complementarity of public and private sectors, the importance of risk management reduction and sharing, and the cost of capital. A quick breakthrough on the scale and purpose of the MDBs is now necessary and must be driven by the MDBs’ shareholders and leaders working together around a shared purpose in relation to a new approach to sustainable, resilient and inclusive development.\n\nSubstantial concessional, or non-debt service, finance will be necessary for key areas of action, including elements of adaptation, resilience, loss and damage, just transition and natural capital restoration/conservation. Important contributors can be official development assistance, special drawing rights, philanthropy, voluntary carbon markets and more. Rich countries must live up to their commitments by delivering on the $100 billion and raising ambition further. It will also be important to be creative and innovative. Concessional and low-cost finance will be essential.",
