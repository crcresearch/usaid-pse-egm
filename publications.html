                The Evidence Gap Map could just as easily be called the “Evidence Map”, meaning that it is a visual representation of existing evidence, using a matrix of USAID’s conceptualization of PSE means and value propositions that both the private sector and development actors offer.  We hope that by compiling this evidence in one place with a number of filter and search features, we will help facilitate the use of evidence.

                  <p>Despite documentation that private sector engagement (PSE) in the humanitarian assistance
                    (HA) field has grown in recent years, robust evidence of its impact is largely lacking. Available
                    evidence of PSE in HA is often based on qualitative findings. This evidence report, the first in a
                    series of three, discusses the evidence and gaps in PSE in HA and is solely based on an
                    analysis of 184 documents, which does not reflect the universe of experience. In brief, the
                    analysis of such engagement seems overwhelmingly positive and cross-cutting across sectors
                    and regions. The main concerns in this context are the lack of comparative studies and a better
                    knowledge of the full extent to which private sector actors engaged in humanitarian assistance.
                    This report is intended for USAID staff, private sector partners, and the broader humanitarian
                    community to understand the state of the evidence in this field to better inform future
                    engagement</p>

                  <p>The wide range of motives and additionalities from the private sector, aid agencies, and aid-receiving government agencies drive private sector engagement (PSE) in humanitarian
                    assistance (HA). Available evidence of PSE in HA is often based on qualitative findings.
                    Nevertheless, private enterprises' role, motives, and barriers to PSE have yet to be fully explored
                    to learn, adapt, and effectively program PSE within HA activities. This evidence report, the second
                    in a series of three, discusses findings related to the motives and barriers of PSE in global and
                    regional contexts and across different sectors, stages, and types of emergencies. Based on an
                    analysis of 184 documents, our results are general insights into PSE in HA but do not aim at
                    statistical validity and generalization. This report is intended for USAID staff, private sector
                    partners, and the broader humanitarian community to understand the state of the evidence in this
                    field to better inform future engagement. In brief, our analysis reveals that while the private sector
                    serves as a useful enabler in HA and disaster relief, more research is required to determine the
                    effects of the barriers and incentives on effective PSE. </p>

                  <p>This evidence report, the last in a series of three, focuses on dissecting the value-added of private
                    sector engagement (VA-PSE) in the humanitarian space. Our results, based on an analysis of
                    184 documents, are general insights into private sector engagement (PSE) in HA but do not aim
                    at statistical validity and generalization. The report is intended for USAID staff, private sector
                    partners, and the broader humanitarian community with the purpose of understanding the state
                    of the evidence in the PSE field. Available evidence of PSE in HA is often based on qualitative
                    findings. In brief, the key takeaway is that the evidence on VA-PSE is not well documented, at
                    least in a way that shows the effects of PSE on the performance of HA activities when controlled
                    for the PSE variable. However, in several instances, the VA-PSE could be comfortably implied
                    based on approaches, partnerships, and achievements documented in the reviewed literature.
                    This study takes advantage of such implied VA-PSE in addition to those that are more explicitly
                    stated. Still, due to methodological limitations, the added value (contribution) may not be entirely
                    attributable to the PSE approaches discussed in many instances.</p>

                  <p>Despite documentation that PSE in the HA field has grown in recent years, robust evidence of its impact is largely lacking and skewed
                    to a few regions/ countries, multinational companies, humanitarian response, and sectors. This analysis reveals that while the private
                    sector serves as a useful enabler in HA and disaster relief, more research is required to determine the effects of barriers and incentives
                    on effective PSE. VA-PSE in HA was also poorly documented in breadth and scope, although we gleaned that most evidence is related
                    to improved reach, while the least documented is related to cost-efficiency. The existing evidence gaps in PSE in HA make it difficult to
                    generalize the findings. </p>
